- Algorithm and coding problems form the largest component of the interview process.
- You should do you best to talk out loud throughout the problem and explain your thought process.

- Afterwards, your interviewer will make an assessment of your performance, usually based on the following:
	- *Analytical Skills*:
		- Did you need much help?
		- How optimal was your solution?
		- How long did it take you to arrive at a solution.
		- If you had to design a new solution, did you structure the problem well and think through the tradeoffs for different decisions?
	- *Coding Skills*:
		- Were you able to successfully translate your algorithm to reasonable code?
		- Was it clean and well-organised?
		- Did you think about potential errors?
		- Did you use good style?
	- *Technical Knowledge / Computer Science Fundamentals*:
		- Do you have a strong foundation in computer science and the relevant technologies?
	- *Experience*:
		- Have you made good technical decisions in the past?
		- Have you built interesting, challenging projects?
		- Have you shown drive, initiative, and other important factors?
	- *Culture Fit / Communication Skills*:
		- Do your personality and values fit with the company and team?
		- Did you communicate well with your interviewer?
