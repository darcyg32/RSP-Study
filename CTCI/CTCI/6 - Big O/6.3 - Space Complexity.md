- Space complexity is a parallel concept to time complexity.
	- If we need to create an array of size *n*, this will require $O(n)$ space.
	- If we need to create a two-dimensional array of size *n* x *n*, this will require $O(n^2)$ space.

- Stack space in recursive calls count too.
- However, just because you have *n* calls total doesn't mean it takes $O(n)$ space.
	- If the calls do not exist simultaneously on the call stack, you only need $O(1)$ space.
