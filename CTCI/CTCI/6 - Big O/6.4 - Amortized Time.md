#Chapter_6 
- In a dynamically resizing array, when resizing, the class will create a new array with double the capacity and copy all the elements over to a new array.
- How do you describe the runtime of insertion?

- If the array is full when inserting a new element, it would take $O(n)$ time.
	- But this doesn't happen very often. The vast majority of the time, insertion will be in $O(1)$ time.
- We need a concept that takes both into account.

- This is what *amortized time* does.
	- It allows us to describe that, yes, this worst case happens every once in a while.
	- But once it happens, it won't happen again for so long that the cost is "amortized".

- In this case, what is the amortized time?
	- As we insert elements, we double the capacity when the size of the array is a power of 2.
	- So after X elements, we double the capacity at array sizes 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, ... X.
		- That doubling takes, respectively, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, ..., X copies.
	- What is the sum of $1+2+4+8+16+...+X$? 
		- This is the same as $X+x/2+x/4+x/8+...+1$, which is roughly 2X.
	- Therefore, X insertions take $O(2X)$ time.
	- The amortized time for each insertion is $O(1)$.
