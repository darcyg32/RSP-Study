- Behavioral questions allow your interviewer to get to know you and your prior experience better.

### Be Specific, Not Arrogant
- Arrogance is a red flag, but you still want to make yourself sound impressive.
- So how do you make yourself sound good without being arrogant? By being specific!

- Specificity means giving just the facts and letting the interviewer derive an interpretation.
	- For example, rather than saying that you "did all the hard parts," you can instead describe the specific bits you did that were challenging. 

### Limit Details
- When a candidate blabbers on about a problem, it's hard for an interviewer who isn't well versed in the subject or project to understand it.
- Stay light on details and just state the key points. When possible, try to translate it or at least explain the impact. 
	- You can always offer the interviewer the opportunity to drill in further. 

- For example:
	- *"By examining the most common user behavior and applying the Rabin-Karp algorithm, I designed a new algorithm to reduce search from O(n) to 0( log n) in 90% of cases. I can go into more details if you'd like.*

- This demonstrates the key points while letting your interviewer ask for more details if he wants to.

### Focus on Yourself, Not Your Team
- Interviews are fundamentally an individual assessment.
- Pay attention to your answers. Listen for how much you say "we" versus 'T' Assume that every question is about your role, and speak to that.

### Give Structured Answers
- There are two common ways to think about structuring responses to a behavioral question: nugget first and S.A.R.
	- These techniques can be used separately or together. 
##### *Nugget First*
- Nugget First means starting your response with a "nugget" that succinctly describes what your response will be about. 
- For example:
	- Interviewer: "*Tell me about a time you had to persuade a group of people to make a big change.*"
	- Candidate: "*Sure, let me tell you about the time when I convinced my school to let undergraduates teach their own courses. Initially, my school had a rule where ...*" 
- This technique grabs your interviewer's attention and makes it very clear what your story will be about. It also helps you be more focused in your communication, since you've made it very clear to yourself what the gist of your response is. 
##### *S.A.R (Situation, Action, Result)*
- The S.A.R. approach means that you start off outlining the situation, then explaining the actions you took, and lastly, describing the result. 
- For example: *"Tell me about a challenging interaction with a teammate."*
	- **Situation**:
		- *On my operating systems project, I was assigned to work with three other people. While two were great, the third team member didn't contribute much. He stayed quiet during meetings, rarely chipped in during email discussions, and struggled to complete his components. This was an issue not only because it shifted more work onto us, but also because we didn't know if we could count on him.* 
	- **Action**:
		- *I didn't want to write him off completely yet, so I tried to resolve the situation. I did three things.* 
			- *First, I wanted to understand why he was acting like this. Was it laziness? Was he busy with something else? I struck up a conversation with him and then asked him open-ended questions about how he felt it was going. Interestingly, basically out of nowhere, he said that he wanted to take on the writeup, which is one of the most time intensive parts. This showed me that it wasn't laziness; it was that he didn't feel like he was good enough to write code.* 
			- *Second, now that I understand the cause, I tried to make it clear that he shouldn't fear messing up. I told him about some of the bigger mistakes that I made and admitted that I wasn't clear about a lot of parts of the project either.*
			- *Third and finally, I asked him to help me with breaking out some of the components of the project. We sat down together and designed a thorough spec for one of the big component, in much more detail than we had before. Once he could see all the pieces, it helped show him that the project wasn't as scary as he'd assumed.*
	- **Result**:
		- *With his confidence raised, he now offered to take on a bunch of the smaller coding work, and then eventually some of the biggest parts. He finished all his work on time, and he contributed more in discussions. We were happy to work with him on a future project.*
- The situation and the result should be succinct. 
	- Your interviewer generally does not need many details to understand what happened and, in fact, may be confused by them.
- By using the S.A.R. model with clear situations, actions and results, the interviewer will be able to easily identify how you made an impact and why it mattered.
- Consider putting your stories into the following grid:

### Explore the Action
- In almost all cases, the "action" is the most important part of the story. 
	- Unfortunately, far too many people talk on and on about the situation, but then just breeze through the action.
- Instead, dive into the action. 
	- Where possible, break down the action into multiple parts. 
	- For example: *"I did three things. First, !..."*
		- This will encourage sufficient depth.

### Think About What It Says
- Re-read the story above. What personality attributes has the candidate demonstrated?
	- **Initiative/Leadership**:
		- The candidate tried to resolve the situation by addressing it head-on.
	- **Empathy**:
		- The candidate tried to understand what was happening to the person. The candidate also showed empathy in knowing what would resolve the teammate's insecurity.
	- **Compassion**:
		- Although the teammate was harming the team, the candidate wasn't angry at the teammate. His empathy led him to compassion.
	- **Humility**:
		- The candidate was able to admit to his own flaws (not only to the teammate, but also to the interviewer).
	- **Teamwork/Helpfulness**:
		- The candidate worked with the teammate to break down the project into manageable chunks.

- You should think about your stories from this perspective. 
	- Analyze the actions you took and how you reacted.
	- What personality attributes does your reaction demonstrate?

- In many cases, the answer is "none."
	- That usually means you need to rework how you communicate the story to make the attribute clearer. 
	- You don't want to explicitly say, "*I did X because I have empathy;'* but you can go one step away from that.
		- For example:
			- **Less Clear Attribute**:
				- *"I called up the client and told him what happened."*
			- **More Clear Attribute (Empathy and Courage)**:
				- *"I made sure to call the client myself, because I knew that he would appreciate hearing it directly from me."*

- If you still can't make the personality attributes clear, then you might need to come up with a new story entirely.
