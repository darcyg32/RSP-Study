- Go through each of the projects or components of your resume and ensure that you can talk about them in detail. 
- Filling out a grid like this:

- Study this grid before your interview. Reducing each story to just a couple of keywords may make the grid easier to study and recall. 
- You can also more easily have this grid in front of you during an interview without it being a distraction.
- In addition, ensure that you have one to three projects that you can talk about in detail. You should be able to discuss the technical components in depth. These should be projects where you played a central role. 

### What Are Your Weaknesses?
- When asked about your weaknesses, give a real weakness! Answers like "*My greatest weakness is that I work too hard*" tell your interviewer that you're arrogant and/or won't admit to your faults. A good answer conveys a real, legitimate weakness but emphasizes how you work to overcome it.
- For example:
	- *"Sometimes, I don't have a very good attention to detail. While that's good because it lets me execute quickly, it also means that I sometimes make careless mistakes. Because of that, I make sure to always have someone else double check my work."* 

### What Questions Should You Ask The Interviewer?
- Walk into the interview with some questions in mind.
- You can think about three general types of questions:
	- *Genuine Questions:*
		- These are the questions you actually want to know the answers to.
			- "*What is the ratio of testers to developers to program managers? What is the interaction like? How does project planning happen on the team?*"
			- "*What brought you to this company? What has been most challenging for you?*"
		- These questions will give you a good feel for what the day-to-day life is like at the company.
	- *Insightful Questions:*
		- These questions demonstrate your knowledge or understanding of technology.
			- *"I noticed that you use technology X. How do you handle problem Y?"*
			- *"Why did the product choose to use the X protocol over the Y protocol? I know it has benefits like A, B, C, but many companies choose not to use it because of issue D."*
		- Asking such questions will typically require advance research about the company.
	- *Passion Questions:*
		- These questions are designed to demonstrate your passion for technology. They show that you're interested in learning and will be a strong contributor to the company. 
			- *"I'm very interested in scalability, and I'd love to learn more about it. What opportunities are there at this company to learn about this?"*
			- *"I'm not familiar with technology X, but it sounds like a very interesting solution. Could you tell me a bit more about how it works?"*
