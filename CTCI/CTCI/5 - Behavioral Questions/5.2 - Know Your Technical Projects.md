#Chapter_5 
- As part of your preparation, you should focus on two or three technical projects that you should deeply master.

- Select projects that ideally fit the following criteria:
	- The project had challenging components (beyond just "learning a lot").
	- You played a central role (ideally on the challenging components).
	- You can talk at technical depth.

- For those projects, and all your projects, be able to talk about the challenges, mistakes, technical decisions, choices of technologies (and tradeoffs of these), and the things you would do differently.
- You can also think about follow-up questions, like how you would scale the application.
