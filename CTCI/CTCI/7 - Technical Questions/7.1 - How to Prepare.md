#Chapter_7
- You need to practice solving problems.

- For each problem, do the following:
	- *Try to solve the problem on your own*:
		- Be sure to think about the space and time efficiency.
	- *Write the code on paper*:
	- *Test your code on paper*:
		- Test the general cases, base cases, error cases, etc.
	- *Type your paper code as-is into a computer*:
		- Start a list of all errors you make so that you can keep these in mind during an actual interview.

- Also try to do as many mock interviews as possible.
