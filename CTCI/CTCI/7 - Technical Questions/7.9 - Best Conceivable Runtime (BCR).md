#Chapter_7 
- Considering the best conceivable runtime can offer a useful hint for some problems.

- The best conceivable runtime is, literally, the *best* runtime you could *conceive* of a solution to a problem having.
	- You can easily prove that there is no way you could beat the BCR.

- For example, suppose you want to compute the number of elements that two arrays (of length A and B) have in common.
	- You immediately know that you can't do that in better than $O(A+B)$ time, because you have to "touch" each element in each array.
	- $O(A+B)$ is the BCR.

- Note that the best conceivable runtime is not necessarily achievable. It says only that you can't do *better* than it.

- If we have a problem with a BCR of $O(n)$, and our current solution is $O(n^2)$ or $O(n\log n)$, we know that precomputation we do that's $O(n)$ or less is "free", as it won't affect our overall runtime.

- If you ever reach the BCR and have $O(1)$ space, then you know you can't optimize the big O time or space.
