### Core Data Structures, Algorithms, and Concepts
- Most interviewers won't ask about specific algorithms for binary tree balancing or other complex algorithms.
- You're usually only expected to know the basics. Here's a list of the absolute, must-have knowledge:

- For each of these topics, make sure you understand how to use and implement them and, where applicable, the space and time complexity.
- Practicing implementing the data structures and algorithms (on paper, and then on a computer) is a great exercise.

- In particular, hash tables are an extremely important topic.

### Powers of 2 Table
- The table below is useful for many questions involving scalability or any sort of memory limitation.

- You should be at least comfortable deriving it.

- For example, you could use this table to quickly compute that a bit vector mapping every 32-bit integer to a boolean value could fit in memory on a typical machine.
	- There are $2^{32}$ such integers.
	- Because each integer takes one bit in this vector, we need that many bits (or $2^{39}$ bytes) to store this mapping.
	- That's about half a gigabyte of memory, which can easily be held in memory on a typical machine.
