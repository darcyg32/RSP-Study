#Chapter_7 
- Candidates don't have to get every question right.

- Responses to interview questions aren't thought of as "correct" or "incorrect".
	- It's not a binary evaluation.
	- It's more about how optimal your final solution was, how long it took you to get there, how much help you needed, and how clean you code was. There is a range of factors.

- Your performance is evaluated *in comparison to other candidates*.

- Many, possibly most, questions are too difficult to expect even a strong candidate to immediately spit out the optimal algorithm.
