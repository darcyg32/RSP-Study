#Chapter_7 
- With Simplify and Generalize, we implement a multi-step approach.
	- First, we simplify or tweak some constraint, such as the data type.
	- Then, we solve this new simplified version of the problem.
	- Finally, once we have an algorithm for the simplified problem, we try to adapt it for the more complex version.
