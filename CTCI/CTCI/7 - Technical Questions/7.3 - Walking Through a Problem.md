- The below flowchart walks through how to solve a problem.

### 1. Listen Carefully
- Mentally record any *unique* information in the problem.
	- For example, if a question begins with the following lines, it's probably for a reason:
		- *"Given two arrays that are sorted, find..."*
			- You probably need to know that the data is sorted. The optimal algorithm for the sorted situation is probably different that the optimal algorithm for the unsorted situation.
		- *"Design an algorithm to be run repeatedly on a server that..."*
			- The to-be-run-repeatedly situation is different from the run-once situation. Perhaps this means you cache data? Or it justifies some reasonable precomputation on the initial dataset?

- It's unlikely that your interviewer would give you this information if it didn't affect the algorithm,
- Your first algorithm doesn't need to use the information, but if you find yourself stuck, ask yourself if you've used all the information in the problem.
- You might even find it useful to write the pertinent information down.

### 2. Draw an Example
- You want to create an example that is:
	- *Specific*: It should use real numbers or strings (if applicable to the problem).
	- *Sufficiently Large*: Most examples are too small, by about 50%.]
	- *Not a Special Case*: Be careful, it's very easy to inadvertently draw a special case. If there's any way your example is a special case (even if you think it won't matter), you should fix it.

### 3. State a Brute Force
- Once you have an example done (although you can do this first for some problems), state a brute force.
	- It's okay and expected that your initial algorithm won't be very optimal.

- Even if the brute force algorithm is obvious for you, it's not necessarily obvious for all candidates.
- You don't want your interviewer to think that you're struggling to see even the easy solution.

- It's okay that your initial solution is terrible. Explain what the space and time complexity is, and then dive into improvements.
- Despite being slow, a brute force algorithm is valuable to discuss.
	- It's a starting point for optimizations, and it helps you wrap you head around the problem.

### 4. Optimize
- Once you have a brute force algorithm, you should work on optimizing it.

- A few techniques that work well are:
	- *Look for any unused information*.
		- Did your interviewer tell you that the array was sorted? How can you leverage that information?
	- *Use a fresh example*.
		- Sometimes, a different example will unclog your mind or help you see a pattern in the problem.
	- *Solve it "incorrectly"*.
		- Just like having an inefficient solution can help you find an efficient solution, having an incorrect solution might help you find a correct solution.
		- It might make other errors more apparent.
	- *Make time vs. space tradeoff*.
		- Sometimes storing extra state about the problem can help you optimize the runtime.
	- *Precompute Information*.
		- Is there a way you can reorganize the data (sorting, etc) or compute some values upfront that will help save time in the long run?
	- *Use a hash table*.
		- Hash tables are widely used in interview questions and should be at the top of your mind.
	- *Think about the best conceivable runtime*.
		- Discussed later.

### 5. Walk Through
- After nailing an optimal algorithm, don't just dive into coding. Take a moment to solidify your understanding of the algorithm.
- Whiteboard coding is very slow, so is testing and fixing it. As a result, you need to make sure that you get it as close to "perfect" in the beginning as possible.
- Walk through your algorithm and get a feel for the structure of the code. Know what the variables are and when they change.

- If you don't understand exactly what you're about to write, you'll struggle to code it.
	- It will take you longer to finish the code, and you're more than likely to make major errors.

### 6. Implement
- Write beautiful code:
	- *Modularized Code*:
		- Shows good coding style and makes things easy for you.
		- If your algorithm uses a matrix initialized to {{1, 2, 3}, {4, 5, 6}, ...}, don't waste time writing the initialization code. Just pretend you have a function `initIncrementalMatrix(int size)`.
		- Fill in the details later if you have to.
	- *Error Checks*:
		- Some interviewers care a lot about this, while others don't.
		- A good compromise here is to add a `todo` and then just explain out loud what you'd like to test.
	- *Use Other Classes/Structs Where Appropriate*:
		- If you need to return a list of start and end points from a function, you could do this as a 2D array.
			- It's better though to do this as list of `StartEndPair` (or possibly `Range`) objects.
		- You don't necessarily have to fill in the details for the class. Just pretend it exists and deal with the details later if you have the time.
	- *Good Variable Names*:
		- Having single-letter variables everywhere is difficult to read.
			- Apart from `i` and `j` where appropriate.
		- But having too long variable names can be slow to write.
		- You can compromise by abbreviating it after the first usage.
			- You can use `startChild` the first time, and then explain to your interviewer that you will abbreviate this as `sc` after this.

- If you see something you can refactor later on, then explain this to your interviewer and decide whether or not it's worth the time to do so.
	- Usually it is, but not always.

- If you get confused, go back to your example and walk through it again.

### 7. Test
- What many candidates do is take their earlier example and test it against their code.
	- That might discover bugs, but it'll take a really long time to do so.
	- Hand testing is very slow.
	- If you really did use a big example to develop your algorithm, it'll take you a long time to find that little off-by-one error at the end of your code.

- Instead, try this approach:
	- *Start With a "Conceptual" Test*:
		- This means just reading and analyzing what each line of code does.
		- Think about it like you're explaining the lines of code for a code reviewer.
		- Does the code do what you think it should do?
	- *Weird Looking Code*:
		- Double check that line of code that says `x = length - 2`.
		- Investigate that `for` loop that starts at `i = 1`.
		- While you undoubtably did this for a reason, it's really easy to get it just slightly wrong.
	- *Hot Spots*:
		- Base cases in recursive code.
		- Integer division.
		- Null nodes in binary trees.
		- The start and end of iteration through a linked list.
		- Etc.
	- *Small Test Cases*:
		- Use a smaller test than your example, it'll likely discover the same bugs, but it will be much faster to do so.
	- *Special Cases*:
		- Test your code against null or single element values, the extreme cases, and other special cases.

- When you find bugs, you should of course fix them. But don't just make the first correction you think of.
	- Instead, carefully analyze why the bug occurred and ensure that your fix is the best one.
