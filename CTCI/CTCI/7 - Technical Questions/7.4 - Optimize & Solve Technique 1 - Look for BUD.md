- "BUD" stands for:
	- Bottlenecks
	- Unnecessary work
	- Duplicated work.

- These are three of the most common things that an algorithm can "waste" time doing.
- You can walk through your brute force looking for these things.
	- When you find one of them, you can focus on getting rid of it.

- If it's still not optimal, you can repeat this approach on your current best algorithm.

### Bottlenecks
- A part of your algorithm that slows down the overall runtime.
- There are two common ways this occurs:
	- *You have one-time work that slows down your algorithm*:
		- For example, you could have an algorithm with two steps. The first of which is $O(n\log n)$ and the second is $O(n)$.
			- Perhaps you could reduce the second step to $O(\log n)$ or $O(1)$, but it's not a priority, as the $O(n\log n)$ is the bottleneck.
			- Until you optimize the first step, your overall algorithm will be $O(n\log n)$.
	- *You have a chunk of work that's done repeatedly, like searching*:
		- Perhaps you can reduce that from $O(n)$ to $O(\log n)$ or $O(1)$, which will greatly speed up your overall runtime.

### Unnecessary Work
- Example: Print all positive integer solutions to the equation $a^3+b^3=c^3+d^3$, where *a, b, c,* and *d* are integers between 1 and 1000.

- A brute force solution will just have four nested loops, something like:

- This algorithm iterates through all possible values of a, b, c, and d and checks if that combination happens to work.

- It's unnecessary to continue checking for other possible values of d. Only one could work.
- We should at least  break after we find a valid solution.

- This won't make a meaningful change to our runtime, it's still $O(n^4)$, but it's still a good, quick fix to make.

- Is there anything else that is unnecessary?
	- Yes, **if there's only one** valid d value for each (a, b, c), we can just compute it.
	- $d= ^3\sqrt{a^3+b^3+c^3}$.

- The `if` statement on line 6 is important. Line 5 will always find a value for d, but we need to check that it's the right integer value.

- This will reduce our runtime from $O(n^4)$ to $O(n^3)$.

### Duplicated Work
- Using the same problem and brute force algorithm as above, let's look for duplicated work this time.

- The algorithm operates by essentially iterating through all (a, b) pairs and then searching all (c, d) pairs to find if there are any matches to that (a, b) pair.

- Why do we keep computing all (c, d) pairs for each (a, b) pair?
	- We should just create the list of (c, d) pairs once. Then, when we have an (a, b) pair, find the matches within the (c, d) list.
	- We can quickly locate the matches by inserting each (c, d) pair into a hash table that maps from the sum to the pair (or, rather, the list of pairs that have that sum).

- Actually, once we have the map of all the (c, d) pairs, we can just use that directly. We don't need to generate the (a, b) pairs. Each (a, b) will already be in the map.

- This will take our runtime to $O(n^2)$.
