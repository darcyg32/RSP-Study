- With Base Case and Build, we solve the problem first for a base case (e.g. n = 1) and then try to build up from there.
- When we get to more complex/interesting cases (often n = 3 or n = 4), we try to build those using the prior solutions.

- Base Case and Build algorithms often lead to natural recursive algorithms.
