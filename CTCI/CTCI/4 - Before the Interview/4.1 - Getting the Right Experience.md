#Chapter_4 
- For current students, this may mean the following:
	- *Take the Big Project Classes*:
		- Seek out the classes with big coding projects.
		- This is a great way to get some practical experience before you have any formal work experience.
		- The more relevant the project is to the real world, the better.
	- *Get an Internship*:
		- Will pave the way for even better internships before you graduate.
	- *Start Something*:
		- Build a project in your own time, participate in hackathons, or contribute to an open source project.

- For professionals, if you're trying to move from a lesser-known company to one of the "biggies":
	- *Shift Work Responsibilities More Towards Coding*:
		- Try to ensure these projects are "meaty", use relevant technologies, and lend themselves well to a resume bullet or two.
	- *Use Your Nights and Weekends*:
		- Build projects in your spare time.
