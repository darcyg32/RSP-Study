- Many algorithms need to process items in a specific order.
	- For example, suppose you must schedule jobs according to their importance relative to other jobs.
		- Such scheduling requires sorting the jobs by importance, and then processing them in this sorted order.
- The *priority queue* is an abstract data type that provides more flexibility than simple sorting, because it allows new elements to enter a system at arbitrary intervals.
	- It can be much more cost-effective to insert a new job into a priority queue than to re-sort everything on each such arrival.
- The basic priority queue supports three primary operations:
	- *Insert(Q, x)*:
		- Given item x, insert it into the priority queue Q.
	- *Find-Minimum(Q) / Find-Maximum(Q)*:
		- Return a pointer to the item whose key value is smallest (or largest) among all keys in the priority queue Q.
	- *Delete-Minimum(Q) / Delete-Maximum(Q):*
		- Remove the item whose key value is minimum (or maximum) from priority queue Q.
- Naturally occurring processes are often informally modeled by priority queues.
	- Single people maintain a priority queue of potential dating candidates, mentally if not explicitly.
		- Once's impression on meeting a new person maps directly to an attractiveness or desirability score, which serves as the *key* field for inserting this new entry into the priority queue data structure.
	- Dating in the process of extracting the most desirable person from the data structure (*Find-Maximum*), spending an evening to evaluate them better, and then reinserting them into the priority queue with a possibly revised score.
- ***Take-Home Lesson:***
	- **Building algorithms around data structures such as [[3.3 - Dictionaries|dictionaries]] and priority queues leads to both clean structure and good performance.**
##### Stop and Think: Basic Priority Queue Implementations
- *Problem:*
	- What is the worst-case time complexity of the three basic priority queue operations (insert, find-minimum, and delete-minimum), when the basic data structure is as follows:
		- An unsorted array?
		- A sorted array?
		- A balanced binary search tree?
- *Solution*:
	- There is surprising subtlety when implementing these operations, even using a data structure as simple as an unsorted array.
	- The unsorted array dictionary implements insertion and deletion in constant time, and search and minimum in linear time.
		- A linear-time implementation of delete-minimum can be composed from *find-minimum*, followed by *delete*.
	- For sorted arrays, we can implement insert and delete in linear time, and minimum in constant time.
		- However, priority queue deletions involve only the minimum element.
		- By storing the sorted array in reverse order (largest value on top), the minimum element will always be the last one in the array.
			- Deleting the tail element requires no movement of any items, just decrementing the number of remaining items n, and so delete-minimum can be implemented in constant time.
	- All this is fine, yet the table below claims we can implement *find-minimum* in constant time for each data structure.
	- ![[Pasted image 20230925003234.png]]
	- The trick is to use an extra variable to store a pointer/index to the minimum entry in each of these structures, so we can simply return this value whenever we are asked to find-minimum.
		- Updating this pointer on insertion is easy, we update it only if the newly inserted value of less than the current minimum.
		- But what happens on delete-minimum?
			- We can delete that minimum element we point to, and then do a search to restore this canned value.
		- The operation to find the new minimum takes linear time on an unsorted array and logarithmic time on a tree, and hence can be folded into the cost of each deletion.
- Priority queues are very useful data structures.
	- Indeed, they will be the hero to two of out *war stories*.
	- A particularly nice priority queue implementation (the heap) will be discussed in the context of sorting in Section 4.3.
	- Further, a complete set of priority queue implementations is presented in Section 15.2.
