#Chapter_2
- Algorithms are the most important and durable part of computer science because they can be studied in a language and machine independent way.
	- This means we need techniques that let us compare the efficiency of algorithms without implementing them.

- Our two most important tools are:
	- [[2.1 - The RAM Model of Computation|The RAM Model of Computation]]; and
	- The asymptotic analysis of computational complexity.

- Assessing algorithmic performance makes use of the [[2.2 - The Big Oh Notation|"Big Oh" notation]] that proves essential to compare algorithms, and design better ones.
	- This method of keeping score will be the most mathematically demanding part of this book.
