- To really understand how backtracking works, you must see how such objects as permutations and subsets can be constructed by defining the right state spaces.
- Examples of several state spaces are described below.

### 9.2.1 - Constructing all Subsets
- Designing an appropriate state space to represent combinatorial objects starts by counting how many objects need representing.
	- How many subsets are there of an *n*-element set, say the integers {1, ..., *n*}?
		- There are exactly two subsets for $n=1$, namely {} and {1}.
			- There are four subsets for $n=2$, and eight for $n=3$.
		- Each new element doubles the number of possibilities, so there are $2^n$ subsets of *n* elements.

- Each subset is described by the elements that are contained in it.
- To construct all $2^n$ subsets, we set up a Boolean array/vector of *n* cells, where the value of $a_i$ (true or false) signifies whether the *i*th item is in the given subset.
- In the scheme of our general backtrack algorithm, $S_k=(true,false)$ and *a* is a solution whenever $k=n$.
- We can now construct all subsets with simple implementations of `is_a_solution()`, `construct_candidates()`, and `process_solution`:

```C
int is_a_solution(int a[], int k, int n) {
	return k == n;
}

void construct_candidate(int a[], int k, int n, int c[], int *nc) {
	c[0] = true;
	c[1] = false;
	*nc = 2;
}

void process_solution(int a[], int k, int input) {
	int i;    // Counter

	printf("{");
	for (i = 1; i <= k; i++) {
		if (a[1] == true) {
			printf(" %d", i);
		}
	}

	printf(" }\n");
}
```

- Finally, we must instantiate the call to `backtrack` with the right arguments.
	- Specifically, this means giving a pointer to the empty solution vector, setting $k=0$ to denote that is in fact empty, and specifying the number of elements in the universal set:

```C
void generate_subsets(int n) {
	int a[NMAX];    // Solution vector
	
	backtrack(a, 0, n);
}
```

- In what order will the subsets of {1, 2, 3} be generated?
	- It depends on the order of moves as returned from `construct_candidates`.
	- Since *true* always appears before *false*, the subset of all trues is generated first, and the all-false empty set is generated last: {123}, {12}, {13}, {1}, {23}, {2}, {3}, and {}.

- Trace through this example (shown in Figure 9.1 (left)) to make sure you understand the backtracking procedure.

### 9.2.2 - Constructing All Permutations
- Counting permutations of {1, ..., *n*} is a necessary prerequisite to generating them.
	- There are *n* distinct choices for the value of the first element of a permutation. Once we have fixed $a_1$, there are $n-1$ candidates remaining for the second position.
		- Repeating this argument yields a total of $n!=\prod_{i=1}^{n}i$ distinct permutations.

- This counting argument suggests a suitable representation.
	- Set up an array/vector *a* of *n* cells.
	- The set of candidates for the *i*th position will be all elements that have not appeared in the $(i-1)$ elements of the partial solution, corresponding to the first $i-1$ elements of the permutation.

- In the scheme of the general backtrack algorithm, $S_k=\{1,...,n\}-\{a_1,...,a_k\}$, and *a* is a solution whenever $k=n$:

```C
void construct_candidates(int a[], int k, int, int c[], int *nc) {
	int i;                 // Counter
	bool in_perm[NMAX];    // What is now in the permutation?

	// Initialize the in_perm array to false for all elements
	for (i = 1; i < NMAX; i++) {
		in_perm[i] = false;
	}

	// Update in_perm to mark elements that are already in the partial permutation
	for (i = 1; i < k; i++) {
		in_perm[a[i]] = true;
	}

	// Initialize the count of candidates to 0
	*nc = 0;

	// Populate the candidates array based on elements not yet in the permutation
	for (i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
		if (!in_perm[i]) {
			c[*nc] = i;    // Add the element to the candidates array
			*nc++;         // Increment the count of candidates
		}
	}
}
```

- Testing whether *i* is a candidate for the *k*th slot in the permutation could be done by iterating through all $k-1$ elements of *a* and verifying that done of them matched.
	- However, we prefer to set up a bit-vector data structure to keep track of which elements are in the partial structure.
		- This gives a constant-time legality check.

- Completing the job requires specifying `process_solution` and `is_a_solution`, as well as setting the appropriate arguments to `backtrack`.
	- All are essentially the same as for subsets:

```C
void process_solution(int a[], int k, int input) {
	int i;    // Counter

	for (i = 1; i <= k; i++) {
		printf(" %d", a[i]);
	}
	printf("\n");
}

int is_a_solution(int a[], int k, int n) {
	return k == n;
}

void generate_permutations(int n) {
	int a[NMAX];    // Solution vector

	backtrack(a, 0, n);
}
```

- As a consequence of the candidate order, these routines generate permutations in *lexicographic*, or sorted order - that is, 123, 132, 213, 231, 312, 321, as shown in Figure 9.1 (right).

### 9.2.3 - Constructing All Paths in a Graph
- In a *simple path*, no vertex appears more than once.
- Enumerating all the simple *s* to *t* paths in a given graph is a more complicated problem than just listing permutations or subsets.
	- There is no explicit formula that counts solutions as a function of the number of edges or vertices, because the number of paths depends upon the structure of the graph.

- The input data we must pass to `backtrack` to construct the paths consists of the input graph `g`, the source vertex `s`, and target vertex `t`:

```C
typedef struct {
	int s;      // Source vertex
	int t;      // Destination vertex
	graph g;    // Graph to find paths in
} paths_data;
```

- The starting point of any path from *s* to *t* is always *s*.
	- Thus, *s* is the only candidate for the first position and $S_1=\{s\}$.
- The possible candidates for the second position are the vertices *v* such that *(s, v)* is an edge of the graph, for the path wanders from vertex to vertex using edges to define the legal steps.
	- In general, $S_{k+1}$ consists of the set of vertices adjacent to $a_k$ that have not been used elsewhere in the partial solution *a*.

```C
void construct_candidates(int a[], int k, paths_data *g, int c[], int *nc) {
	int i;                    // Counter
	bool in_sol[NMAX + 1];    // What's already in the solution?
	edgenode* p;              // Temp pointer
	int last;                 // Last vertex on curent path

	for (i = 1; i <= g->g.nvertices; i++) {
		in_sol[i] = false;
	}

	for (i = 0; i < k; i++) {
		in_sol[a[i]] = true;
	}

	if (k == 1) {
		c[0] = g->s;          // Always start from vertex s
		*nc = 1;
	} else {
		*nc = 0;
		last = a[k - 1];
		p = g->g.edges[last];
		while (p != NULL) {
			if (!in_sol[p->y]) {
				c[*nc] = p->y;
				*nc++;
			}
			p = p->next;
		}
	}
}
```

- We report a successful path whenever $a_k=t$.

```C
int is_a_solution(int a[], int k, paths_data* g) {
	return a[k] == g->t;
}
```

- The number of paths discovered can be counted in `process_solution` by incrementing a global variable `solution_count`.
- The sequence of vertices for each path is stored in the solution vector `a`, ready to be printed:

```C
void process_solution(int a[], int k, paths_data *input) {
	int i;    /* counter */
	solution_count ++;
	printf("{");
	for (i = 1; i <= k; i++) {
		printf(" %d",a[i]);
	}
	printf(" }\n");
}
```

- The solution vector must have room for all *n* vertices, although most paths should be shorter than this.
- Figure 9.2 shows the search tree giving all paths from the source vertex in a particular graph.
