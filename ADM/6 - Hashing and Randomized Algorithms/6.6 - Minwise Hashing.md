- Hashing lets you quickly test whether a specific word *w*in document $D_1$ also occurs in document $D_2$: build a hash table on the words of $D_2$ and then hunt for $h(w)$ in this table *T*.
	- For simplicity and efficiency we can remove duplicate words from each document, so each contains only one entry for each vocabulary word used.
- By looking up all the vocabulary words $w_i\in D_1$ in *T*, we can get a count of the intersection, and compute the *Jaccard similarity* $J(D_1, D_2)$ of the two documents, where $J(D_1,D_2)=\frac{|D_1\cap D_2|}{|D_1\cup D_2|}$.
	- This similarity measure ranges from 0 to 1, sort of like a probability that the two documents are similar.
