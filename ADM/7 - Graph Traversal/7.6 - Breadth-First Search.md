#Chapter_7
- The basic bread-first search algorithm is given below.
- At some point during the course of a traversal, every node in the graph changes state from *undiscovered* to *discovered*.

- In a breadth-first search of an undirected graph, we assign a direction to each edge, from the discoverer *u* to the discovered *v*.
	- We thus denote *u* to be the parent of *v*.
- Since each node has exactly one parent, except for the root, this defines a tree on the vertices of the graph.
- This tree, illustrated in Figure 7.9, defines a shortest path from the root to every other node in the tree.

- This property makes breadth-first search very useful in shortest path problems.
###### Pseudocode:
BFS(*G, s*)
	Initialize each vertex $u \in V[G]$ so
		*state\[u]* = "undiscovered"
		*p\[u]* = *nil* (i.e. no parent is in the BFS tree)
	*state\[s]* = "discovered"
	*Q* = {*s*}
	while *Q* != nill
		*u* = dequeue\[*Q*]
		process vertex *u* if desired
		for each vertex *v* that is adjacent to *u*
			process edge (*u, v*) if desired
			if *state\[v]* = "undiscovered" then
				*state\[v]* = "discovered"
				*p\[v]* = *u*
				enqueue\[*Q, v*]
		*state\[u]* = "processed"

- The graph edges that do not appear in the breadth-first search also have special properties.
	- For undirected graphs, non-tree edges can point only to vertices on the same level as the parent vertex, or to vertices on the level directly below the parent.
		- These properties follow easily from the fast that each path in the tree must be a shortest path in the graph.
	- For a directed graph, a back-pointing edge (*u, v*) can exist whenever *v* lies closer to the root than *u* does.
### Implementation
- Our implementation uses two boolean arrays to maintain our knowledge about each vertex in the graph.
	- A vertex is `discovered` the first time we visit it.
	- A vertex is `processes` after we have traversed all outgoing edges from it.
	- Thus, each vertex passes from `unsdiscovered` to `discovered` to `processes` over the course of the search.
- This information could have been maintained using one enumerated type variable, but we used two boolean variables instead.
```C
bool processed[MAXV + 1];    // Which vertices have been processed
bool discovered[MAXV + 1];   // Which vertices have been  found
int parent[MAXV + 1];        // Discovery relation
```

- Each vertex is initialized as undiscovered:
```C
void initialize_search(graph *g) {
	int i;                   // Counter

	time = 0;

	for (i = 0 ; i <= g->nvertices ; i++) {
		processed[i] = false;
		discovered[i] = false;
		parent[i] = -1;
	}
}
```

- Once a vertex is discovered, it is placed on a queue.
- Since we process these vertices in first-in, first-out (FIFO) order, the oldest vertices are expanded first, which are exactly those closest to the root:
```C
void bfs(graph *g, int start) {
	queue q;        // Queue of vertices to visit
	int v;          // Current vertex
	int y;          // Successor vertex
	edgenode *p;    // Temporary pointer

	init_queue(&q);
	enqueue(&q, start);
	disocvered[start] = true;

	while (!empty_queue(&q)) {
		v = dequeue(&q);
		process_vertex_early(v);
		processed[v] = true;
		p = g->edges[v];
		while (p != NULL) {
			y = p->y;
			if (!processed[y] || g->directed) {
				process_edge(v, y);
			}
			if (!discovered[y]) {
				enqueue(&q, y);
				discovered[y] = true;
				parent[y] = v;
			}
			p = p->next;
		}
		process_vertex_late(v);
	}
}
```

## 7.6.1 Exploiting Traversal
- The exact behavior of `bfs` depends upon the functions `process_vertex_early()`, `process_vertex_late()`, and `process_edge()`.
- Through these functions, we can customize what the traversal does as it makes its one official visit to each edge and each vertex.
- Initially, we will do all vertex processing on entry, so `process_vertex_late()` returns without action:
```C
void process_vertex_late(int v) {

}
```

- By setting the active functions to:
```C
void process_vertex_early(int v) {
	printf("processed vertex %d\n", v);
}

void process_edge(int x, int y) {
	printf("processed edge (%d, %d)\n", x, y);
}
```
- we print  each vertex and edge exactly once.
- If we instead set `process_edge` to:
```C
void process_edge(int x, int y) {
	nedges = nedges + 1;
}
```
- we get an accurate count of the number of edges.
- Different algorithms perform different actions on vertices or edges as they are encountered.
- These functions give us the freedom to easily customize these actions.

## 7.6.2 Finding Paths
- The `parent` array that is filled over the course of `bfs()` is very useful for finding interesting paths through a graph.
- The vertex that first discovered vertex *i* is defined as the `parent[i]`.
	- Every vertex is discovered once during the course of traversal, so every node has a parent, except for the start node.
- This parent relation defines a tree of discovery, with the start node as the root of the tree.

- Because vertices are discovered in order of increasing distance from the root, this tree has a very important property.
	- The unique tree path from the root to each node $x \in V$ uses the smallest number of edges (or equivalently, intermediate nodes) possible on any root-to-*x* path in the graph.

- We can reconstruct this path by following the chain of ancestors from *x* to the root.
- Note that we have to work backward. We cannot find the path from the root to *x*, because this does not agree with the direction of the parent pointers.
- Since this is the reverse of how we normally want the path, we can either:
	- 1. Store it and then explicitly reverse it using a stack, or
	- 2. Let recursion reverse it for us, as follows:
```C
void find_path(int start, int end, int parents[]) {
	if (start == end || end == -1) {
		printf("\n%d", start);
	} else {
		find_path(start, parents[end], parents);
		printf(" %d", end);
	}
}
```

- On our breadth-first search graph example (Figure 7.9), our algorithm generated the following parent relation:
![[Pasted image 20231027134506.png]]

- For the shortest path from 1 to 6, this parent relation yields the path {1, 2, 5, 6}.

- There are two points to remember when using BFS to find a shortest path from *x* to *y*:
	1. The shortest path tree is only useful if BFS was performed with *x* as the root of the search.
	2. BFS gives the shortest path only if the graph is unweighted.
- We will present algorithms for finding shortest paths in weighted graphs in Section 8.3.1.
