#Chapter_7
- A graph $G=(V,E)$ consists of a set of *vertices* *V* together with a set *E* of vertex pairs or *edges*.

- Graphs are important because they can be used to represent essentially *any* relationship.
	- For example, graphs can model a network of roads, with cities as vertices and roads between cities as edges.
	- Electrical circuits can also be modeled as graphs, with junctions as vertices and components as edges (or electrical components as vertices and direct circuit connections as edges).

- The key to solving many algorithmic problems is to think of them in terms of graphs.
- Graph theory provides a language for talking about the properties of relationships, and it is amazing how often messy applied problems have a simple description and solution in terms of classical graph properties.

- Designing truly novel graph algorithms is a difficult task, but usually unnecessary.
	- The key lies in taking advantage of existing algorithms.
	- Becoming familiar with many different algorithmic graph *problems* is more important than understanding the details of particular graph algorithms.

- Here we'll present the basic data structures and traversal operations for graphs, which will enable you to cobble together solutions for elementary graph problems.
- Chapter 8 will present more advanced algorithms that find minimum spanning trees, shortest paths, and network flows.
