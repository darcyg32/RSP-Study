#Chapter_7
- [[7.8 - Depth-First Search|DFS]]'s correctness requires getting subtle details right.

- The correctness of a DFS-based algorithm depends upon specifics of exactly *when* we process the edges and vertices.
	- We can process vertex *v* either before we have traversed *any* outgoing edge from *v* (`process_vertex_early()`), or after we have finished processing *all* of them (`process_vertex_late()`).
- Sometimes we will take special actions at both times, say `process_vertex_early()` to initialize a vertex-specific data-structure, which will be modified on edge-processing operations and then analyzed afterwards using `process_vertex_late()`.

- In undirected graphs, each edge (*x, y*) sits in the adjacency lists of vertex *x* and *y*.
- There are thus two potential times to process each edge (*x, y*), namely when exploring *x* and when exploring *y*.
- The labeling of edges as tree edges or back edges occurs the first time the edge is explored.
- The first time we see an edge is usually a logical time to do edge-specific processing.
- Sometimes, we may want to take different action the second time we see an edge.

- But when we encounter edge (*x, y*) from *x*, how can we tell if we have previously traversed the  edge from *y*?
	- The issue is easy is vertex *y* is undiscovered:
		- (*x, y*) becomes a tree edge so this must be the first time.
	- The issue is also easy if *y* has been completely processed:
		- We explored the edge when we explored *y* so this must be the second time.
	- But what if *y* is an ancestor of *x*, and this in a discovered state?
		- Careful reflection will convince you that his must be our first traversal *unless* *y* is the immediate of *x*, that is, (*y, x*) is a tree edge.
		- This can be established by testing if `y == parent[x]`.

### 7.9.1 - Finding Cycles
- Back edges are the key to finding a cycle in an undirected graph.
- If there is no back edge, all edges are tree edges, and no cycle exists in the tree.
- But *any* back edge going from *x* to an ancestor *y* creates a cycle with the tree path from *y* to *x*.
- Such a cycle is easy to find using `dfs`:
```C
void process_edge(int x, int y) {
	if (parent[y] != x) {   // Found back edge!
		printf("Cycle from %d to %d:", y, x);
		find_path(y, x, parent);
		finished = true;
	}
}
```

- The correctness of this cycle detection algorithm depends upon processing each undirected edge exactly once.
	- Otherwise, a spurious two-vertex cycle (*x, y, x*) could be composed from the two traversals of any single undirected edge.
- We use the `finished` flag to terminate after finding the first cycle.
	- Without it we would waste time discovering a new cycle with every back edge before stopping;
	- A complete graph has $\Theta (n^2)$ such cycles.

### 7.9.2 - Articulating Vertices
- Suppose you are a vandal seeking to disrupt the telephone trunk network. Which station in Figure 7.11 should you blow up to cause the maximum amount of damage?
	- Observe that there is a single point of failureâ€”a single vertex whose deletion disconnects a connected component of the graph.
![[Pasted image 20231030104706.png]]
- Such a vertex *v* is called an *articulation vertex* or *cut-node*.
- Any graph that contains an articulation vertex is inherently fragile, because deleting *v* causes a loss of connectivity between other nodes.

- I presented a breadth-first search-based connected components algorithm in [[7.7 - Applications of Breadth-First Search|Section 7.7.1]].
- In general, the *connectivity* of a graph is the smallest number of vertices whose deletion will disconnect the graph.
	- The connectivity is 1 if the graph has an articulation vertex.
	- More robust graphs without such a vertex are said to be *biconnected*.

- Testing for articulation vertices by brute force is easy.
	- Temporarily delete each candidate vertex *v*, then do a BFS or DFS traversal of the remaining graph to establish whether it is still connected.
	- The total time for *n* such traversals is $O(n(n+m))$.
		- There is a clever linear-time algorithm, however, that tests all the vertices of a connected graph using a single DFS.

- What might the DFS tree tell us about articulation vertices?
- This tree connects all the vertices of a connected component of the graph.
- If the DFS tree represented the entirety of the graph, all internal (non-leaf) nodes would be articulation vertices, since deleting any one of them would separate a leaf from the root.
- But blowing up a leaf (shown in Figure 7.12) would not disconnect the tree, because it connects no one but itself to the main trunk.
![[Pasted image 20231030110917.png]]

- The root of the search tree is a special case.
	- If it only has one child, it functions as a leaf/
	- But if the root has two or more children, its deletion disconnects them, making the root an articulation vertex.

- General graphs are more complex than trees. But a DFS of a general graph partitions the edges into tree edges and back edges.
	- Think of these back edges as security cables linking a vertex back to one of its ancestors.
	- The security cable from *x* back to *y* ensures that none of the vertices on the tree path between *x* and *y* can be articulation vertices.
	- Delete any of these vertices, and the security cable will still hold all of them to the rest of the tree.

- Finding articulation vertices requires keeping track of the extent to which back edges (i.e. security cables) link chunks of the DFS tree back to ancestor nodes.
- Let `reachable_ancestor[v]` denote the earliest reachable ancestor of vertex *v*, meaning the oldest ancestor of *v* that we can reach from a descendant of *v* by using a back edge.
- Initially, `reachable_ancestor[v] = v`:
```C
int reachable_ancestor[MAXV + 1];    // Earliest reachable ancestor of v
int tree_out_degree[MAXV + 1];       // DFS tree outdegree of v

void process_vertex_early(int v) {
	reachable_ancestor[v] = v;
}
```

- We update `reachable_ancestor[v]` whenever we encounter a back edge that takes us to an earlier ancestor than we have previously seen.
- The relative age/rank of our ancestors can be determined from their `entry_time`'s:
```C
void process_edge(int x, int y) {
	int class;    // Edge class

	class = edge_classification(x, y);

	if (class == TREE) {
		tree_out_degree[x] = tree_out_degree[x] + 1;
	}

	if (class == BACK && parent[x] != y) {
		if (entry_time[y] < entry_time[reachable_ancestor[x]]) {
			reachable_ancestor[x] = y;
		}
	}
}
```

- The key issue is determining how the reachability relation impacts whether vertex *v* is an articulation vertex.
- There are three cases, illustrated in Figure 7.13 and discussed below.
	- Note that these cases are not mutually exclusive. A single vertex *v* might be an articulation vertex for multiple reasons:

- *Root cut-nodes*:
	- If the root of the DFS tree has two or more children, it must be an articulation vertex. No edges from the subtree of the second child can possibly connect to the subtree of the first child.
- *Bridge cut-nodes*:
	- If the earliest reachable vertex from *v* is *v*, then deleting the single edge (*parent\[v], v*) disconnects the graph.
	- Clearly *parent\[v]* must be an articulation vertex, since it cuts *v* from the graph.
	- Vertex *v* is also an articulation vertex unless it is a leaf of the DFS tree.
		- For any leaf, nothing falls off when you cut it.
- *Parent cut-nodes*:
	- If the earliest reachable vertex from *v* is the parent of *v*, then deleting the parent must sever *v* unless the parent is the root.
	- This is always the case for the deeper vertex of a bridge, unless it is a leaf.
![[Pasted image 20231030112614.png]]

- The routine below systematically evaluates each of these three conditions as we back up from the vertex after traversing all outgoing edges.
- We use `entry_time[v]` to represent the age of vertex *v*.
- The reachability time `time_v` calculated below denotes the oldest vertex that can be reached using back edges.
- Getting back to an ancestor above *v* rules out the possibility of *v* being a cut-node:
```C
void process_vertex_late(int v) {
	bool root;       // Is parent[v] the root of the DFS tree?
	int time_v;      // Earliest reachable time for v
	int time_parent; // Earliest reachable time for parent[v]

	// Test if v is the root
	if (parent[v] == -1) {
		if (tree_out_degree[v] > 1) {
			printf("root articulation vertex: %d \n", v);
		}
		return;
	}

	root = (parent[parent[v]] == -1); // Is parent[v] the root?

	if (!root) {
		if (reachable_ancestor[v] == parent[v]) {
			printf("parent articulation vertex: %d \n", parent[v]);	
		}

		if (reachable_ancestor[v] == v) {
			printf("bridge articulation vertex: %d \n",parent[v]);

			// Is v not a leaf?
			if (tree_out_degree[v] > 0) {
				printf("bridge articulation vertex: %d \n", v);
			}
		}
	}

	time_v = entry_time[reachable_ancestor[v]];
	time_parent = entry_time[reachable_ancestor[parent[v]]];

	if (time_v < time_parent) {
		reachable_ancestor[parent[v]] = reachable_ancestor[v];
	}
}
```

- The last lines of this routine govern when we back up from a node's highest reachable ancestor to its parent, namely whenever it is higher than the parent's earliest ancestor to date.

- We can alternatively talk about vulnerability in terms of edge failures instead of vertex failures.
	- Perhaps our vandal would find it easier to cut a cable instead of blowing up a switching station.
	- A single edge whose deletion disconnects the graph is called a *bridge*; any graph without such an edge is said to be *edge-biconnected*.

- Identifying whether a given edge (*x, y*) is a bridge is easily done in linear time, by deleting the edge and testing whether the resulting graph is connected.
- In fact all bridges can be identified in the same $O(n+m)$ time using DFS.
	- Edge (*x, y*) is a bridge if:
		1. It is a tree edge, and
		2. No back edge connects from *y* or below to *x* or above.
- This can be computed with an appropriate modification to the `process_late_vertex` function.
