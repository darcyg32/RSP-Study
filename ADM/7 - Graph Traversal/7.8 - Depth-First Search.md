#Chapter_7
- There are two primary graph traversal algorithms:
	- [[7.6 - Breadth-First Search|Breadth-First Search (BFS)]], and
	- Depth-First Search (DFS).
- For certain problems, it makes no difference which you use, but in others the distinction is crucial.

- The difference between BFS and DFS lies in the order in which they explore vertices.
- This order depends completely upon the container data structure used to store the *discovered* but not *processed* vertices.

- *Queue*:
	- By storing the vertices in a first-in, first-out (FIFO) queue, we explore the oldest unexplored vertices first.
	- Out explorations thus radiate out slowly from the starting vertex, defining a **breadth-first** search.

- *Stack*:
	- By storing the vertices in a last-in, first-out (LIFO) stack, we explore the vertices by forging steadily along a path, visiting a new neighbor if one is available, and backing up only when we are surrounded by previously discovered vertices.
	- Our explorations thus quickly wander away from the starting point, defining a **depth-first** search.

- Our implementation of `dfs` maintains a notion of traversal *time* for each vertex.
- Our `time` clock ticks each time we enter or exit a vertex.
- We keep track of the *entry* and *exit* times for each vertex.

- Depth-first search has a neat recursive implementation, which eliminates the need to explicitly use a stack:

DFS(*G, u*)
	*state\[u]* = "discovered"
	process vertex *u* if desired
	*time++*
	*entry\[u]* = *time*
	for each vertex *v* that is adjacent to *u*
		process edge (*u, v*) if desired
		if *state\[v]* = "undiscovered", then
			*p\[v] = u*
			DFS(*G, v*)
	*state\[u]* = "processed"
	*exit\[u]* = *time*
	*time*++

- The time intervals have interesting and useful properties with respect to depth-first search:
	- *Who is an ancestor?*
		- Suppose that *x* is an ancestor of *y* in the DFS tree.
		- This implies that we must enter *x* before *y*, since there is no way we can be born before our own parent or grandparent!
		- We must also exit *y* before we exit *x*, because the mechanics of DFS ensure we cannot exit *x* until after we have backed up from the search of all its descendants.
		- Thus, the time interval of *y* must be properly nested within the interval of ancestor *x*.
		- A vertex *x* is an ancestor of *y* if the entry time of *x* is earlier than that of *y*, and the exit time of *y* is later than that of *v*.
	- *How many descendants?*
		- The difference between the exit and entry times for *v* tells us how many descendants *v* has in the DFS tree.
		- The clock gets incremented on each vertex entry and vertex exit, so **half the time difference** denotes the number of descendants of *v*.

- We will use these entry and exit times in several applications of DFS, particularly topological sorting and biconnected/strongly connected components.
- We may need to take separate actions on each entry and exit, thus motivating distinct `process_vertex_early` and `process_vertex_late` routines called from `dfs`.

- For the DFS tree example presented in Figure 7.10, the parent of each vertex with its entry and exit times are:

- The other important property of a DFS is that it partitions the edges of an undirected graph into exactly two classes:
	- *Tree edges*, and
	- *Back edges*.
- The tree edges discover new vertices, and are those encoded in the `parent` relation.
- Back edges are those who other endpoint is an ancestor of the vertex being expanded, so they point back into the tree.

- An amazing property of DFS is that all edges fall into one of these two classes.
- Why can't an edge go to a sibling or cousin node, instead of an ancestor?
	- All nodes reachable from a given vertex *v* are expanded before we finish with the traversal from *v*, so such topologies are impossible for undirected graphs.
- This edge classification proves fundamental to the correctness of DFS-based algorithms.

### Implementation
- DFS can be thought of as BFS, but using a stack instead of a queue to store unfinished vertices.
- The beauty of implementing `dfs` recursively is that recursion eliminates the need to keep an explicit stack:
```C
void dfs(graph *g, int v) {
	edgenode *p;    // Temp pointer
	int y;          // Successor vertex

	if (finished) {
		return;     // Allow for search termination
	}

	discovered[v] = true;
	time++;
	entry_time[v] = time;

	process_vertex_early(v);

	p = g->edges[v];
	while (p != NULL) {
		if (!discovered[y]) {
			parent[y] = v;
			process_edge(v, y);
			dfs(g, y);
		} else if ((!processed[y] && parent[v] != y) || g->directed) {
			process_edge(v, y);
		}

		if (finished) {
			return;
		}
		p = p->next;
	}

	process_vertex_late(v);
	time++;
	exit_time[v] = time;
	processed[v] = true;
}
```

- DFS uses essentially the same idea as *backtracking*, which we study in Section 9.1.
- Both involve exhaustively searching all possibilities by advancing if it is possible, and backing up only when there is no remaining unexplored possibility for further advance.
- Both are most easily understood as recursive algorithms.

- **DFS organizes vertices by entry/exit times, and edges into tree and back edges.**
- **This organization is what gives DFS its real power**.
