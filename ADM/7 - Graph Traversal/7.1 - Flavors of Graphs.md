#Chapter_7
- A graph $G=(V,E)$ is defined on a set of *vertices V*, and contains a set of *edges E* of ordered or unordered pairs of vertices from *V*.
	- In modelling a road network, the vertices may represent the cities or junctions, certain pairs of which are connected by roads/edges.
	- In analyzing the source code of a computer program, the vertices may represent lines of code, with an edge connecting lines *x* and *y* if *y* is the next statement executed after *x*.
	- In analyzing human interactions, the vertices typically represent people, with edges connecting pairs or related souls.

- Several fundamental properties of graphs impact the choice of the data structures used to represent them, and algorithms available to analyze them.
- The first step in any graph is determined the flavors of the graphs that you will be dealing with (See Figure 7.2).

- *Undirected vs. Directed*:
	- A graph $G=(V,E)$ is *undirected* if the presence of edge $(x,y)$ in *E* implies that edge $(y,x)$ is also in *E*.
	- If not, we say that the graph is *directed*.
	- E.g.:
		- Road networks *between* cities are typically undirected, since any large road has lanes going in both directions.
		- Street networks *within* cities are almost always directed, because there are at least a few one-way streets somewhere.
		- Program-flow graphs are typically directed, as the execution flows from one line into the next and changes direction only at branches.
		- Most graphs of graph-theoretic interest are undirected.

- *Weighted vs. Unweighted*:
	- Each edge (or vertex) in a *weighted* graph *G* is assigned a numerical value, or weight.
		- The edges of a road network graph might be weighted with their length, drive time, or speed limit, depending on the application.
	- In *unweighted* graphs, there is no cost distinction between edges and vertices.
	- The difference between weighted and unweighted graphs becomes particularly apparent in finding the shortest path between two vertices.
		- For unweighted graphs, a shortest path is one that has the fewest number of edges, and can be found using a bread-first search (BFS).
		- Shortest paths in weighted graphs requires more sophisticated algorithms.

- *Simple* vs. *Non-Simple*:
	- Certain types of edges complicate the task of working with graphs.
		- A *self-loop* is an edge $(x,x)$ involving only one vertex.
		- An edge $(x,y)$ is a *multiedge* if it occurs more than once in the graph.
	- Both of these structures require special care in implementing graph algorithms. Hence any graph that avoids them is called *simple*.
	- All implementations in this book are designed to work *only* on simple graphs.

- *Sparse* vs. *Dense*:
	- Graphs are *sparse* when only a small fraction of the possible vertex pairs actually have edges defined between them.
	- Graphs where a large fraction of the vertex pairs define edges are called *dense*.
	- A graph is *complete* if it contains all possible edges.
		- For a simple undirected graph on *n* vertices, that is $(^n_2)=(n^2 - n)/2$  edges.
	- There is no official boundary between what is called sparse and what is called dense, but dense graphs typically have $\Theta (n^2)$ edges, while sparse graphs are linear in size.
	- Sparse graphs are usually sparse for application-specific reasons.
		- Road networks must be sparse because of the complexity of road junctions.
		- Junctions of electrical components are similarly limited to the number of wires that can meet at a point, perhaps except for power and ground.

- *Cyclic* vs. *Acyclic*:
	- A *cycle* is a closed path of 3 or more vertices that has no repeating vertices except the start/end pint.
	- An *acyclic* graph does not contain any cycles.
	- *Trees* are directed graphs that are connected and acyclic.
		- They are the simplest interesting graphs.
		- Trees are inherently recursive structures, because cutting any edge leaves two smaller trees.
	- Directed acyclic graphs are called *DAG*s.
		- They arise naturally in scheduling problems, where a directed edge $(x,y)$ indicated that activity *x* must occur before *y*.
		- A operation called *topological sorting* orders the vertices of a DAG to respect these precedence constraints.
			- Topological sorting is typically the first step of any algorithm on a DAG, as will be discussed in section 7.10.1.

- *Embedded vs. Topological*:
	- The edge-vertex representation $G=(V,E)$ describes the purely topological aspects of a graph.
	- We say a graph is *embedded* if the vertices and edges are assigned geometric positions.
		- Thus, any drawing of a graph is an *embedding*, which may or may not have algorithmic significance.
	- Occasionally, the structure of a graph is completely defined by the geometry of its embeddings.
		- For example, if we are given a collection of points in the plane, and seek the minimum cost tour visiting all of them (i.e. the traveling salesman problem), the underlying topology is the *complete graph* connecting each pair of vertices.
	- The weights are typically defined by the Euclidean distance between each pair of points.
	- Grids of points are another example of topology from geometry.
		- Many problems on an *n x m* rectangular grid involve walking between neighbouring points, so the edges are implicitly defined from the geometry.

- *Implicit vs. Explicit*:
	- Certain graphs are not explicitly constructed and then traversed, but built as we use them.
	- A good example is in backtrack search.
		- The vertices of this implicit search graph are the states of the search vector, while edges link pairs of states that can be directly generated from each other.
	- Another example is web-scale analysis, where you should try to dynamically crawl and analyze the small relevant portion of interest instead of initially downloading the entire web.
	- The cartoon in Figure 7.2 tries to capture this distinction between the part of the graph you explicitly know from the fog that covers the rest, which dissipates as you explore it.
	- It is often easier to work with an implicit graph than to explicitly construct and store the entire thing prior to analysis.

- *Labeled vs. Unlabeled*:
	- Each vertex is assigned a unique name of identifier in a *labeled* graph to distinguish it from all other vertices.
		- In *unlabeled* graphs, no such distinctions have been made.
	- Graphs arising in applications are often naturally and meaningfully labeled, such as city names in a transportation network.
	- A common problem is that of *isomorphism testing* - determining whether the topological structures of two graphs are identical either respecting or ignoring any labels, as discussed in Section 19.9
