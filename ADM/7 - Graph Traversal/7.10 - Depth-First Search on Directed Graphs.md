- [[7.8 - Depth-First Search||DFS]] on an undirected graph proves useful because it organizes the edges of the graph in a very precise way.
	- Over the course of a DFS from a given source vertex, each edge will be assigned one of potentially four labels, as shown in Figure 7.14.

- When traversing *undirected* graphs, every edge is either in the DFS tree or will be a back edge to an ancestor in the tree. It is important to understand why.
	- Might we encounter a "forward edge" (*x, y*), directed toward a descendant vertex?
		- No, because in this case, we would have first traversed *(x, y)* while exploring *y*, making it a back edge.
	- Might we encounter a "cross edge" (*x, y*), linking two unrelated vertices?
		- Again no, because we would have first discovered this edge when we explored *y*, making it a tree edge.

- But for *directed* graphs, DFS labelings can take on a wider range of possibilities.
	- Indeed, all four of the edge cases in Figure 7.14 can occur in traversing directed graphs.
	- This classification still proves useful in organizing algorithms on directed graphs, because we typically take a different action on edges from each different class.

- The correct labeling of each edge can be readily determined from the state, discovery time, and parent of each vertex, as encoded in the following function:

```C
int edge_classification(int x, int y) {
	if (parent[y] == x) {
		return TREE;
	}

	if (discovered[y] && !processed[y]) {
		return BACK;
	}

	if (processed[y] && (entry_time[y] > entry_time[x])) {
		return FORWARD;
	}

	if (processed[y] && (entry_time[y] < entry_timep[x])) {
		return CROSS;
	}

	printf("Warning: Self Loop (%d, %d)\n", x, y);
	return -1;
}
```

- Just as with BFS, this implementation of the DFS algorithm includes places to optionally process each vertex and edge - say to copy them, print them, or count them.

- Both DFS and BFS will traverse all edges in the same connected component as the starting point.
- Both must start with a vertex in each component to traverse a disconnected graph.
- The only important difference between them is the way they organize and label the edges.

### 7.10.1 - Topological Sorting
- Topological sorting is the most important operation on directed acyclic graphs (DAGs).
	- It orders the vertices on a line such that all directed edges go from left to right.
		- Such an ordering cannot exist if the graph contains a directed cycle, because there is no way you can keep moving right on a line and still return to where you starting from!
- Each DAG has at least one topological sort.

- The importance of topological sorting is that it gives us an ordering so we can process each vertex before any of its successors.
- Suppose the directed edges represented precedence constraints, such that edge (*x, y*) means job *x* must be done before job *y*.
	- Any topological sort then defines a feasible schedule.
- Indeed, there can be many such orderings for a given DAG.

- But the applications go deeper.
- Suppose we seek the shortest (or longest) path from *x* to *y* in a DAG.
	- No vertex *v* appearing after *y* in the topological order can possibly contribute to any such path, because there will be no way to get from *v* back to *y*.
	- We can appropriately process all the vertices from left to right in topological order, considering the impact of their outgoing edges, and know that we will have looked at everything we need before we need it.
- Topological sorting proves very useful in essentially any algorithmic problem on DAGS.

- Topological sorting can be performed efficiently using DFS.
	- A directed graph is a DAG only iff no back edges are encountered.
- Labeling the vertices in the reverse order that they are marked *processed* defines a topological sort of a DAG.
- Why? Consider what happens to each directed edge (*x, y*) as we encounter it exploring vertex *x*:
	- If *y* is currently *undiscovered*, then we start a DFS of *y* before we can continue with *x*. 
		- Thus, *y* must be marked *processed* before *x* is, so *x* appears before *y* in the topological order, as it must.
	- If *y* is discovered but not *processed*, then (*x, y*) is a back edge, which is impossible in a DAG because it creates a cycle.
	- If *y* is *processed*, then it will have been so labeled before *x*.
		- Therefore, *x* appears before *y* in the topological order, as it must.

```C
void process_vertex_late(int v) {
	push(&sorted, v);
}

void process_edge(int x, int y) {
	int class;    // Edge class

	class = edge_classification(x, y);

	if (class == BACK) {
		printf("Warning: Directed cycle found, not a DAG\n");
	}
}

void topsort(graph *g) {
	int i;    // Counter

	init_stack(&sorted);

	for (i = 1; i <= g->nvertices; i++) {
		if (!discovered[i]) {
			dfs(g, i);
		}
	}
	print_stack(&sorted);    // Report topological order
}
```

- We push each vertex onto a stack as soon as we have evaluated all outgoing edges.
	- The top vertex on the stack always has no incoming edges from any vertex on the stack.
	- Repeatedly popping them off yields a topological ordering.

### 7.10.2 - Strongly Connected Components
- A directed graph is *strongly connected* if there is a directed path between any two vertices.

- It is straightforward to use graph traversal to test whether a graph $G=(V,E)$ is strongly connected in linear time.
	- The graph is strongly connected only if from any vertex *v* in *G*:
		- All vertices are reachable from *v*; and
		- All vertices can reach *v*.
	- To test if the first condition holds, we can do a BFS or DFS traversal from *v* to establish whether all vertices get discovered.
		- If so, all must be reachable from *v*.

- To test if there are paths from every vertex to *v*, we construct the *transpose* graph $G^T=(V,E')$, which has the same vertex and edge set as *G*, but will all edges reversed.
	- That is, directed edge $(x, y)\in E$ only if $(y,x)\in E'$.

```C
graph *transpose(graph *g) {
	graph *gt;    // Transpose of graph g
	int x;        // Counter
	edgenode *p;  // Temporary pointer

	gt = (graph *) malloc(sizeof(graph));
	initialize_graph(gt, true);    // Initialize directed graph
	gt->nvertices=g->nvertices;

	for (x = 1; x <= g->nvertices; x++) {
		p = g->edges[x];
		while (p != NULL) {
			insert_edge(gt, p->y, x, true);
			p = p->next;
		}
	}

	return gt;
}
```

- Any path from *v* to *z* in $G^T$ corresponds to a path from *z* to *v* in *G*.
	- By doing a second DFS, this one from *v* in $G^T$, we identify all vertices that have paths *to* *v* in *G*.

- All directed graphs can be partitioned into *strongly connected components*, such that a directed path exists between every pair of vertices in the component, as shown in Figure 7.16 (left).

![[Pasted image 20231130103638.png]]

- The set of such components can be determined using a more subtle variation of this double DFS approach:

```C
void strong_components(graph *g) {
	graph *gt;    // Transpose of graph g
	int i;        // Counter
	int v;        // Vertex in component

	init_stack(&dfs1order);
	initialize_search(g);
	for (i = 1; i <= g->nvertices; i++) {
		if (!discovered[i]) {
			dfs(g, i);
		}
	}

	gt = transpose(g);
	initialize_search(gt);

	components_found = 0;
	while (!empty_stack(&dfs1order)) {
		v = pop(&dfs1order);
		if (!discovered[v]) {
			components_found++;
			printf("Component %d:", components_found);
			dfs2(gt, v);
			printf("\n");
		}
	}
}
```

- The first traversal pushes the vertices on a stack in the reverse order they were processed, just as with topological sort in Section 7.10.1.
- The connection makes sense:
	- DAGs are directed graphs where each vertex forms its own strongly connected component.
	- On a DAG, the top vertex on the stack will be one that cannot be reached from any other vertex.
- The bookkeeping here is identical to topological sort:

```C
void process_vertex_late(int v) {
	push(&dfs1order, v);
}
```

- The second traversal, on the transposed graph, behaves like the connected component algorithm of [[7.7 - Applications of Breadth-First Search|Section 7.7.1]], except we consider starting vertices in order they appear on the stack.
	- Each traversal from *v* will discover all reachable vertices from the transpose $G^T$, meaning the vertices that have paths to *v* in *G*.
	- These reachable vertices define the strongly connected component of *v*, because they represent the least reachable vertices in G:

```C
void process_vertex_early2(int v) {
	printf(" %d", v);
}
```

- The correctness of this is subtle.
- Observe that first DFS places vertices on the stack in groups based on reachability from successive starting vertices in the original directed graph *G*.
	- Thus, the vertices in the top group have the property that *none* were reachable from *any* earlier group vertex.
- The second traversal in $G^T$, starting from the last vertex *v* of *G*, finds all the reachable vertices from *v* in $G^T$ that themselves reach *v*, meaning they define a strongly connected component.
