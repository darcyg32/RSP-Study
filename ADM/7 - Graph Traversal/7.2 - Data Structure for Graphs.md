- Selecting the right graph data structure can have an enormous impact on performance.
- Your two basic choices are adjacency matrices and adjacency lists, illustrated in Figure 7.4.
- We assume the graph $G=(V,E)$ contains *n* vertices and *m* edges.

- *Adjacency Matrix*:
	- We can represent *G* using and *n x n* matrix *M*, where element $M[i,j]=1$ if $(i,j)$ is an edge of G, and 0 if it isn't,
		- This allows fast answers to the question "is (*i, j*) in *G*?", and rapid updates for edge insertion and deletion.
		- It may use excessive space for graphs with many vertices and relatively few edges, however.

	- Consider a graph that represents the street map of Manhattan in NY.
		- Every junction of two streets will be a vertex of the graph.
		- Neighbouring junctions are connected by edges.
		- How big is this graph?
			- Manhattan is basically a grid of 15 avenues each crossing roughly 200 streets.
			- This gives us about 3,000 vertices and 6,000 edges, since almost all vertices neighbor four other vertices and each edge is shared between two vertices.
			- This is a modest amount of data to store, yet an adjacency matrix would have 3,000 * 3,000 = 9,000,000 elements, almost all of them empty!

		- There is some potential to save space by packing multiple bits per word, or using a symmetric-matrix data structure (e.g. a triangular matrix) for undirected graphs.
			- But these methods lose the simplicity that makes adjacency matrices so appealing and, more critically, remain inherently quadratic even for sparse graphs.

- *Adjacency Lists*:
	- We can more efficiently represent sparse graphs by using linked lists to store the neighbors of each vertex.
	- Adjacency lists require pointers, but are not frightening once you have experience with linked structures.

	- Adjacency lists make it harder to verify whether a given edge *(i, j)* is in *G*, since we must search through the appropriate list to find the edge.
	- However, it is surprisingly easy to design graph algorithms that avoid any need for such queries.
	- Typically, we sweep through all the edges of the graph in one pass via a bread-first or depth-first traversal, and update the implications of the current edge as we visit it.

- Table 7.5 summarizes the tradeoffs between adjacency lists and matrices.

- Adjacency lists are the right data structure for most applications of graphs.

- We will use adjacency lists as our primary data structure to represent graphs.
- We represent a graph using the following data type.
- For each graph, we keep a count of the number of vertices, and assign each vertex a unique identification number from 1 to `nvertices`.
- We represent the edges using an array of linked lists:
```C++
#define MAXV 100                // Max number of vertices

typedef struct edgenode {
	int y;                      // Adjacency info
	int weight;                 // Edge weight, if any
	struct edgenode *next;      // Next edge in list
} edgenode;

typedef struct {
	edgenode *edges[MAXV + 1];  // Adjaceny info
	int degree[MAXV + 1];       // Outdegree of each vertex
	int nvertices;              // Number of vertices in the graph
	int nedges;                 // Number of edges in the graph
	bool directed;              // Is the graph directed?
} graph;
```

- We represent directed edge (*x, y*) by an `edgenode` *y* in *x*'s adjacency list.
- The degree field of the `graph` counts the number of meaningful entries for the given vertex.
- An undirected edge (*x, y*) appears twice in any adjacency-based graph structure, once as *y* in *x*'s list, and the other as *x* in *y*'s list.
- The Boolean flag `directed` identifies whether the given graph is to be interpreted as directed or undirected.

- To demonstrate the use of this data structure, we show how to read a graph from a file.
	- A typical graph file format consists of an initial line giving the number of vertices and edges in the graph, followed by a list of the edges, one vertex pair per line.
	- We start by initializing the structure:
```C++
void initialize_graph(graph *g, bool directed) {
	int i;    // Counter

	g->nvertices = 0;
	g->nedges = 0;
	g->directed = directed;

	for (i = 1 ; i <= MAXV ; i++) {
		g->degree[i] = 0;
	}

	for (i = 1 ; i <= MAXV ; i++) {
		g->edges[i] = NULL;
	}
}
```

- Then we actually read the graph file, inserting each edge into this structure:
```c++
void read_graph(graph *g, bool directed) {
	int i;    // Counter
	int m;    // Number of edges
	int x, y; // Vertices in edge (x, y)

	initialize_graph(g, directed);

	scanf("%d, %d", &(g->nvertices), &m);

	for (i = 1 ; i <= m ; i++) {
		scanf("%d, %d", &x, &y);
		insert_edge(g, x, y, directed);
	}
}
```

- The critical routine is `insert_edge`.
	- The new `edgenode` is inserted at the beginning of the appropriate adjacency list, since order doesn't matter.
	- We parameterize our insertion with the `directed` Boolean flag, to identify whether we need to insert two copies of each or only one.
	- Note the use of recursion to insert the copy:
```c++
void insert_edge(graph *g, int x, int y, bool directed) {
	edgenode *p;                     // Temporary pointer

	p = malloc(sizeof(edgenode));    // Allocate edgenode storage

	p->weight = 0;
	p->y = y;
	p->next = g->edges[x];

	g->edges[x] = p;                 // Insert at head of list

	g->degree[x]++;

	if (!directed) {
		insert_edge(g, y, x, true);
	} else {
		g->nedges++;
	}
}
```

- Printing the associated graph is just a matter of two nested loops:
	- One through the vertices, and the second through adjacent edges:
```c++
void print_graph(graph *g) {
	int i;
	edgenode *p;

	for (i = 0 ; i <= g->nvertices ; i++) {
		printf("%d: ", i);
		p = g->edges[i];
		while (p != NULL) {
			printf(" %d", p->y);
			p = p->next;
		}
		printf("\n");
	}
}
```

- It is a good idea to use a well-designed graph data type as a model for building your own, or even better as the foundation for your application.
	- I recommend LEDA (page 713) or Boost (page 714) as the best-designed general-purpose graph data structures currently available.
