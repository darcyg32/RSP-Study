- When you don't know the right answer, the best thing to do is guess.
- Principled guessing is called *estimation*.

- Estimation problems are best solved through some kind of logical reasoning process, typically a mix of principled calculations and analogies.
	- *Principles calculations* give the answer as a function of quantities that either you already know, can look up on Google, or feel confident enough to guess.
	- *Analogies* reference your past experience, recalling those that seem similar to some aspect of the problem at hand.

- A best practice in estimation is to try to solve the problem in different ways and see if the answers generally agree in magnitude.
