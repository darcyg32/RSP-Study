#Chapter_1 
- Although some computer scientists only know how to prove things by [[1.4 - Induction and Recursion|induction]], this isn't true of everyone. The best sometimes use *contradiction*.

- The basic scheme of a contradiction argument is as follows:
	- Assume that the hypothesis (the statement you want to prove) is *false*.
	- Develop some logical consequences of this assumption.
	- Show that one consequence is demonstrably false, thereby showing that the assumption is incorrect and the hypothesis is true.
