#Chapter_1 
- Failure to find a counterexample to a given algorithm does not mean "it is obvious" that the algorithm is correct.
	- A proof or demonstration of correctness is needed.
	- Often mathematical induction is the method of choice.

- Recursion and induction are similar because recursion *is* mathematical induction in action.
- In both, we have general and boundary conditions, with the general condition breaking the problem into smaller and smaller pieces.
- The *initial* or boundary condition terminates the recursion.

- Consider the correctness of *insertion sort*. The *reason* it is correct can be shown inductively:
	- The basic case consists of a single element, and by definition a one-element array is completely sorted.
	- We assume that the first $n-1$ elements of array *A* are completely sorted after $n-1$ iterations of insertion sort.
	- To insert one last element *x* to *A*, we find where it goes, namely the unique spot between the biggest element less than or equal to *x* and the smallest element greater than *x*.
		- This is done by moving all the greater elements back by one position, creating room for *x* in the desired location. ∎

- However, very subtle reasoning errors can creep into inductive proofs.
	- The first are *boundary errors*:
		- For example, our insertion sort correctness proof above boldly stated that there was a unique place to insert *x* between two elements, when our basis case was a single-element array. Greater care is needed to properly deal with the special cases of inserting the minimum or maximum elements.
	- The second and more common class of inductive proof errors concerns cavalier extension claims:
		- Adding one extra item to a given problem instance might cause the entire optimal solution to change.
		- This was the case in our scheduling problem. The optimal schedule after inserting a new segment may contain none of the segments of any particular optimal solution prior to insertion.
		- Boldly ignoring such difficulties can lead to very convincing inductive proofs of incorrect algorithms.

##### Stop and Think: Incremental Correctness
- *Problem*:
	- Prove the correctness of the following recursive algorithm for incrementing natural numbers, that is, $y\to y+1$.
		Increment(*y*)
			if ($y=0$) then return (1) else
				if ($y$ mod $2$) $=1$ then
					return($2*$Increment($y/2$))
				else return($y+1$)

- *Solution*:
	- Proving by induction, we can see the basis case of $y=0$ is obviously correctly handled. Clearly the value 1 is returned, and $0+1=1$
	- Now assume the function works correctly for the general case of $y=n-1$.
		- Given this, we must demonstrate the truth for the case of $y=n$.
	- The cases corresponding to even numbers are obvious, because $y+1$ is explicitly returned when ($y$ mod $2$) $=0$.
	- For odd numbers, the answer depends on what Increment($y/2$) returns.
		- Here we want to use our inductive assumption, but it isn't quite right.
		- We have assumed that Increment worked correctly for $y=n-1$, but not for a value that is about half of it.
		- We can fix this problem by strengthening our assumption to declare that the general case holds for all $y\leq n-1$.
		- This costs us nothing in principle, but is necessary to establish the correctness of the algorithm.
	- Now, the case of odd *y* (i.e. $y=2m+1$ for some integer $m$) can be dealt with as:![[Pasted image 20231120111246.png]]
	- And the general case is resolved. ∎
