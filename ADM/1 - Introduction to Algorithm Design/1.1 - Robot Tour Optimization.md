- The following problem provides a good demonstration as to why it's important to properly prove for correctness in algorithm analysis.

- ***Problem:*** Robot Tour Optimization
- ***Input:*** A set *S* of *n* points in the plane.
- ***Output:*** What is the shortest cycle tour that visits each point in the set *S*?

- Several algorithms may come to mind to solve this problem.

- Perhaps the most popular idea is the *nearest-neighbour* heuristic.
	- Starting from some point $p_0$, we walk first to its nearest neighbour $p_1$.
	- From $p_1$, we walk to its nearest unvisited neighbour, thus excluding $p_0$ as a candidate.
	- We now repeat this process until we run out of unvisited points, after which we return to $p_0$ to close off the tour.
	- Written in pseudocode:
		NearestNeighbor(P)
			Pick and visit an initial point $p_0$ from $P$
			$p = p_0$
			$i=0$
			While there are still unvisited points
				$i++$
				Select $p_i$ to be the closest unvisited point to $p_{i-1}$
				Visit $p_i$
			Return to $p_0$ from $p_{n-1}$

	- This algorithm is simple to understand and implement. The basic idea makes sense. It works perfectly on the example in Figure 1.2. It is reasonable efficient.
		- But it is completely wrong.
	- The algorithm always finds a tour, but it doesn't necessarily find the shortest possible tour.
	- Consider the set of points in Figure 1.3, all of which lie along a line.![[Pasted image 20231120092330.png]]

- A correct algorithm could involve enumerating *all* possible orderings of the set of points, and then selecting the one that minimizes the total length:
		OptimalTSP(*P*)
			$d=\infty$
			For each of the $n!$ permutations $P_i$ of point set $P$
				If $(cost(P_i)\leq d)$ then $d=cost(P_i)$ and $P_{min}=P_i$
			Return $P{min}$
- Since all possible orderings are considered, we are guaranteed to end up with the shortest possible tour.
- This algorithm is correct, but also extremely slow.

- The quest for an efficient algorithm to solve this problem, called the *traveling salesman problem* (TSP), will take us through much of this book.

- **Take-Home Lesson:**
	- *There is a fundamental difference between *algorithms*, procedures that always produce a correct result, and *heuristics*, which may usually do a good job but provide no guarantee of correctness.*
