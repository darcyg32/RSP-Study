- ***Problem:*** Movie Scheduling Problem
- ***Input:*** A set *I* of *n* intervals on the line.
- ***Output:*** What is the largest subset of mutually non-overlapping intervals that can be selected from *I*?

- There are several ideas that come to mind.
- One is based on the notion that it is best to work whenever work is available:
		EarliestJobFirst(*I*)
			Accept the earliest starting job *j* from *I* that does not overlap any previously accepted job, and repeat until no more such jobs remain.
- This idea makes sense, but accepting the earliest job might block of from taking many other jobs if that first job is long, as shown in Figure 1.6(L)

- Perhaps we should instead start by taking the shortest job, and keep seeking the shortest available job at every turn:
		ShortestJobFirst(*I*)
			While ($I\ne null$) do
				Accept the shortest possible job *j*from *I*.
				Delete *j*, and any interval that intersects *j*, from *I*.
- Again this idea makes sense, but accepting the shortest job might block us from taking two other jobs, as shown in Figure 1.6(R)

- Once again, as with the TSP problem (in [[1.1 - Robot Tour Optimization]]), an algorithm where we try all possibilities may start to look good.
	- We can be certain exhaustive search is correct.
- If we ignore the details of testing whether a set of intervals are in fact disjoint, it looks something like this:
		ExhaustiveScheduling(*I*)
			$j=0$
			$S_{max}=null$
			For each of the $2^n$ subsets of $S_i$ of intervals *I*
				If ($S_i$ is mutually non-overlapping) and ($size(S_i)>j$)
					then $j=size(S_i)$ and $S_{max}=S_i$
			Return $S_{max}$
- Although this solution isn't as inefficient ($\Theta (2^n)$) as the solution proposed for the robot tour optimization problem ($\Theta (n!)$), it is still quite slow, and can be improved.

- Think about the first job to terminate - that is, the interval *x* whose right endpoint is left-most among all intervals.
	- Other jobs may well have started before *x*, but all of these must at least partially overlap each other.
	- Thus, we can select at most one from the group.
	- The first of these jobs to terminate is *x*, so any of the overlapping jobs potentially block out other opportunities to the right of it.
	- Clearly we can never lose by picking *x*.
		OptimalScheduling(*I*)
			While ($I\ne null$) do
				Accept the job *j* from *I* with the earliest completion date.
				Delete *j*, and any interval which intersects *j*, from *I*.

- Ensuring the optimal answer over all possible inputs is a difficult but often achievable goal.
- Seeking counterexamples that break pretender algorithms is an important part of the algorithm design process.

- ***Take-Home Lesson:***
	- *Reasonable-looking algorithms can easily be incorrect. Algorithm correctness is a property that must be carefully demonstrated.*
