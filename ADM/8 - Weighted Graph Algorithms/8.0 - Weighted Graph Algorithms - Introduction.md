#Chapter_8
- The data structures and traversal algorithms of [[7.0 - Graph Traversal - Introduction|Chapter 7]] provide the basic building blocks for any computation on graphs.
- However, all the algorithms presented there dealt with unweighted graphs (aka graphs where each edge has identical value or weight).

- There is an alternate universe of problems for *weighted graphs*.
- Identifying the shortest path in such graphs proves more complicated than [[7.6 - Breadth-First Search|BFS]] in unweighted graphs, but opens the door to a wide range of applications.

- The [[7.2 - Data Structure for Graphs|graph data structure from Chapter 7]] quietly supported edge-weighted graphs, but here this is made explicit.
- Our adjacency list again consists of an array of linked lists, such that the outgoing edges from vertex *x* appear in the list `edges[x]`.
```C
typedef struct {
	edgenode *edges[MAXV + 1]; // Adjacency info
	int degree[MAXV + 1];      // Outdegree of each vertex
	int nvertices;             // Number of vertices in the graph
	int nedges;                // Number of edges in the graph
	bool directed;              // Is the graph directed?
} graph;
```

- Each `edgenode` is a record containing three fields, the first describing the second endpoint of the edge (`y`), the second enabling us to annotate the edge with a weight (`weight`), and the third pointing to the next edge in the list (`next`):
```C
typedef struct edgenode {
	int y;                  // Adjacency info
	int weight;             // Edge weight, if any
	struct edgenode *next;  // Next edge in list
} edgenode;
```

- We not describe several algorithms for weighted graphs that use this data structure, including [[8.1 - Minimum Spanning Trees|minimum spanning trees]], shortest paths, and maximum flows.
