#Chapter_8
- The data structures and traversal algorithms of [[7.0 - Graph Traversal - Introduction|Chapter 7]] provide the basic building blocks for any computation on graphs.
	- However, all the algorithms presented there dealt with unweighted graphs, where each edge has identical value or weight.

- There is an alternate universe of problems for *weighted graphs*.
	- The edges of road networks are naturally bound to numerical values such as construction cost, traversal time, length, or speed limit.
- Identifying the shortest path in such graphs proves more complicated than [[7.6 - Breadth-First Search|breadth-first search]] in unweighted graphs, but opens the door to a wide range of applications.

- The graph data structure from Chapter 7 quietly supported edge-weighted graphs, but here this is made explicit.
- Our adjacency list structure again consists of an array of linked lists, such that the outgoing edges from vertex *x* appear in the list `edges[x]`.

```C
typedef struct {
	edgenode* edges[MAXV + 1];    // Adjacency info
	int degree[MAXV + 1];         // Outdegree of each vertex
	int nvertices;                // Number of vertices in the graph
	int nedges;                   // Number of edges in the graph
	int directed;                 // Is the graph directed?
} graph;
```

Each `edgenode` is a record containing three fields, the first describing the second endpoint of the edge (`y`), the second enabling us to annotate the edge with a weight (`weight`), and the third pointing to the next edge in the list (`next`):

```C
typedef struct edgenode {
	int y;                    // Adjacency info
	int weight;               // Edge weight, if any
	struct edgenode* next;    // Next edge in list
} edgenode;
```

- We now describe several sophisticated algorithms for weighted graphs that use this data structure, including [[8.1 - Minimum Spanning Trees|minimum spanning trees]], shortest paths, and maximum flows.
