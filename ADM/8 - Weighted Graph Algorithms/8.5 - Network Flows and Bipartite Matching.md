- An edge-weighted graph can be interpreted as a network of pipes, where the weight of an edge determines the *capacity* of the pipe.
- Capacities can be though of as a function of the cross-sectional area of the pipe.
	- A wide pipe might be able to carry 10 units of flow, that is, the amount of material in a given time, whereas a narrower pipe can only carry 5 units.
- The *network flow problem* asks for the maximum amount of flow that can be sent from vertices *s* to *t* in a given weighted graph *G* while respecting the maximum capacities of each pipe.

### 8.5.1 - Bipartite Matching
- While the network flow problem is of independent interest, its primary importance lies in solving other important graph problems.
	- A classic example is bipartite matching.
- A *matching* in a graph $G=(V,E)$ is a subset of edges $E' \subset E$ such that no two edges of $E'$ share a vertex
	- A matching pairs off certain vertices such that every vertex is in at most one such pair, as shown in Figure 8.10.

- Graph *G* is *bipartite* or *two-colorable* if the vertices can be divided into two sets, *L* and *R*, such that all edges in *G* have one vertex in *L* and one vertex in *R*.
- Many naturally defined graphs are bipartite.
	- For example, one class of vertices may represent jobs to be done and the remaining vertices represent people who can potentially join them.
		- The existence of edge $(j, p)$ means that job *j* can be done by person *p*.
	- Or let certain vertices represent boys and certain vertices represent girls, with edges representing compatible pairs.

- The maximum cardinality bipartite matching can be readily found using network flow.
	- Create a *source* node *s* that is connected to every vertex in *L* by an edge of weight 1.
	- Create a *sink* node *t* and connect it to every vertex in *R* by an edge of weight 1.
	- Finally, assign each edge in the central bipartite graph *G* a weight of 1.
- Now, the maximum possible flow from *s* to *t* defines the largest matching in *G*.
	- Certainly we can find a flow as large as the matching, by using the matching edges and their source-to-sink connections,
- Further, there can be no other solution that achieves greater flow, because we can't possibly get more than one flow unit through any given vertex.

### 8.5.2 - Computing Network Flows
- Traditional network flow algorithms are based on the idea of *augmenting paths*:
	- Finding a path of positive capacity from *s* to *t* and adding it to the flow.
- It can be shown that the flow through a network is optimal only iff it contains no augmenting path.
	- Since each augmentation increases the flow, by repeating the process until no such path remains we must eventually find the global maximum.

- The key structure is the *residual flow graph*, denoted as $R(G, f)$, where *G* is the input graph whose weights are the capacities, and $f$ is the array of flows through *G*.
	- The directed, edge-weighted graph $R(G,f)$ contains the same vertices as *G*.
	- For each edge $(i,j)$ in *G* with capacity $c(i,j)$ and flow $f(i, j)$, $R(G,f)$ may contain two edges:
		- An edge $(i,j)$ with weight $c(i,j)-f(i,j)$, if $c(i,j)-f(i,j)>0$; and
		- An edge $(i,j)$ with weight $f(i,j)$, if $f(i,j)>0$;
	- The weight of the edge $(i,j)$ in the residual graph gives the exact amount of extra flow that can be pushed from *i* to *j*.
	- A path in the residual flow graph from *s* to *t* implies that more flow can be pushed from *s* to *t*.
	- The smallest edge weight on this path defines the amount of extra flow that can be pushed along with it.

![[Pasted image 20231207111705.png]]

- Figure 8.11 illustrates this idea.
- The maximum *s-t* flow in graph *G* is 7.
	- Such a flow is revealed by the two directed *t* to *s* paths in the residual graph $R(G)$, of flows 2 and 5 respectively.
	- These flows completely saturate the capacity of the two edges incident to vertex *t*, so no augmenting path remains.
	- Thus, the flow is optimal.
- A set of edges whose deletion separates *s* from *t* (like the two edges incident to *t*) is called an *s-t* cut.
	- Clearly, not *s* to *t*flow can exceed the weight of the minimum such cut.
	- In fact, a flow equal to the minimum cut is always possible.

- A *cut* in a graph is a partition of its nodes into two disjoint sets.
	- The capacity of the cut is the sum of capacities of the edges crossing the cut.
	- A min-cut is the cut with the minimum capacity among all possible cuts.

- ***Take-Home Lesson*:
	- ***The maximum flow from s to t always equals the weight of the minimum s-t cut.*
	- ***Thus, flow algorithms can be used to solve general edge and vertex connectivity problems in graphs.*

##### Implementation
- We cannot do full justice to the theory of network flows here.
	- However, it is instructive to see how augmenting paths can be identified and the optimal flow computed.

- For each edge in the residual flow graph, we must keep track of both the amount of flow currently going through the edge, as well as its remaining *residual* capacity.
	- Thus, we must modify out `edge` structure to accommodate the extra fields:

```C
typedef struct {
	int v;                    // Neighbouring vertex
	int capacity;             // Capacity of edge
	int flow;                 // Flow through edge
	int residual;             // Residual capacity of edge
	struct edgenode* next;    // Next edge in list
} edgenode;
```

- We use a [[7.6 - Breadth-First Search|breadth-first search]] to look for any path from source to sink that increases the total flow, and use it to augment the total.
	- We terminate with the optimal flow when no such *augmenting* path exists.

```C
void netflow(flow_graph* g, int source, int sink) {
	int volume;    // Weight of the augmenting path

	add_residual_edges(g);

	initialize_search(g);
	bfs(g, source);

	volume = path_volume(g, source, sink);

	while (volume > 0) {
		augment_path(g, source, sink, volume);
		initialize_search(g);
		bfs(g, source);
		volume = path_volume(g, source, sink);
	}
}
```

- Any augmenting path from source to sink increases the flow, so we can use BFS to find such a path.
	- We only consider network edges that have remaining capacity or, in other words, positive residual flow.
	- The predicate below helps BFS distinguish between saturated and unsaturated edges:

```C
bool valid_edge(edgenode* e) {
	return e->residual > 0;
}
```

- Augmenting a path transfers the maximum possible volume from the residual capacity into positive flow.
	- This amount is limited by the path edge with the smallest amount of residual capacity, just as the rate at which traffic can flow is limited by the most congested point.

```C
int path_volume(flow_graph* g, int start, int end) {
	edgenode* e;    // Edge in question

	if (parent[end] == -1) {
		return 0;
	}

	e = find_edge(g, parent[end], end);

	if (start == parent[end]) {
		return e->residual;
	} else {
		return min(pathvolume(g, start, parent[end]), e->residual);
	}
}
```

- Recall that BFS uses the parent array to record the discoverer of each vertex on the traversal, enabling us to reconstruct the shortest path back to the root from any vertex.
	- The edges of this tree are vertex pairs, not the actual edges in the graph data structure on which the search was performed.
- The call `find_edge(g, x, y)` returns a pointer to the record encoding edge *(x, y)* in graph *g*, necessary to obtain its residual capacity.
	- The `find_edge` routine can find this pointer by scanning the adjacency list of *x* ( `g->edges[x]`), or (even better) from an appropriate table lookup data structure.

- Sending an additional unit of flow along directed edge *(i, j)* reduces the residual capacity of edge *(i, j)* but *increases* the residual capacity of edge *(j, i)*.
	- Thus, the act of augmenting a path requires modifying both forward and reverse edges for each link on the path.

```C
void augment_path(flow_graph* g, int start, int end, int volume) {
	edgenode* g;    // Edge in question

	if (start == end) {
		return;
	}

	e = find_edge(g, parent[end], end);
	e->flow += volume;
	e->residual -= volume;

	e = find_edge(g, end, parent[end]);
	e->residual += volume;

	augment_path(g, start, parent[end], volume);
}
```

- Initializing the flow graph requires creating directed flow edges *(i, j)* and *(j, i)* for each network edge $e=(i,j)$.
- Initial flows are all set to 0.
- The initial residual flow of *(i, j)* is set to the capacity of *e*, while the initial residual flow of (*j, i*) is set to 0.

##### Analysis
- The augmenting path algorithm above eventually converges to the optimal solution.
	- However, each augmenting path may add only a little to the total flow, so, in principle, the algorithm might take an arbitrarily long time to converge.
