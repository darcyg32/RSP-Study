#Chapter_8
- A *spanning tree* of a connected graph $G=(V,E)$ is a subset of edges from *E* forming a tree connecting all vertices of *V*.
- For edge-weighted graphs, we are particularly interested in the *minimum spanning tree* - the spanning tree whose sum of edge weights is as small as possible.

- Minimum spanning trees are the answer whenever we need to connect a set of points (representing cities, homes, junctions, or other locations) cheaply using the smallest amount of roadway, wire, or pipe.
- *Any* tree is the smallest possible connected graph in terms of number of edges, but the minimum spanning tree is the smallest connected graph in terms of edge weight.
- In geometric problems, the point set $p_1,...,p_n$ defines a complete graph, with edge $(v_i,v_j)$ assigned a weight equal to the distance from $p_i$ to $p_j$.
- An example of a geometric minimum spanning tree is illustrated in Figure 8.1.

- A minimum spanning tree minimizes the total edge weight over all possible spanning trees.
- However, there can be more than one minimum spanning tree of a given graph.
	- Indeed, all spanning trees of an unweighted (or equally weighted) graph *G* are minimum spanning trees, since each contains exactly $n-1$ equal-weight edges.
	- Such a spanning tree can be found using either DFS or BFS.
- Finding a minimum spanning tree is more difficult for general weighed graphs. But two different algorithms are presented below, both demonstrating the optimality of specific greedy heuristics.

## 8.1.1 Prim's Algorithm
- Prim's minimum spanning tree algorithm starts from one vertex, and grows the rest of the tree one edge at a time until all vertices are included.

- Greedy algorithms make the decision of what to do next by selecting the best local option from all available choices, without regard to the global structure.
- Since we seek the tree of minimum weight, the natural greedy algorithm for minimum spanning tree (MST) repeatedly selects the smallest weight edge that will enlarge the number of vertices in the tree.

Prim-MST(*G*)
	Select an arbitrary vertex *s* to start the tree $T_{prim}$ from.
	While (there are still non-tree vertices)
		Find the minimum-weight edge between a tree and non-tree vertex
		Add the selected edge and vertex to the tree $T_{prim}$.

- Prim's algorithm clearly creates a spanning tree, because no cycle can be introduced by adding edges between tree and non-tree vertices. But why should it be of minimum weight over *all* spanning trees?

- We use proof by contradiction.
- Suppose that there existed a graph *G* for which Prim's algorithm did not return a minimum spanning tree.
	- Since we are building the tree incrementally, this means that there must have been some particular instant where we went wrong.
	- Before we inserted edge (*x, y*), $T_{prim}$ consisted of a set of edges that was a subtree of some minimum spanning tree $T_{min}$, but choosing edge (*x, y*) fatally took us away from any minimum spanning tree (see Figure 8.2(a)).
- But how could we have gone wrong?
	- There must be a path *p* from *x* to *y* in $T_{min}$, as shown in Figure 8.2(b).
	- This path must use an edge $(v_1, v_2)$, where $v_1$ is already in $T_{prim}$, but $v_2$ is not.
	- This edge $(v_1, v_2)$ must have weight at least that of $(x,y)$, or else Prim's algorithm would have selected it before $(x,y)$ when it had the chance.
	- Inserting $(x,y)$ and deleting $(v_1, v_2)$ from $T_{min}$ leaves a spanning tree no larger than before, meaning that Prim's algorithm could not have made a fatal mistake in selecting edge $(x,y)$.
- Therefore, by contradiction, Prim's algorithm must construct a minimum spanning tree.

##### Implementation
- Prim's algorithm grows the minimum spanning tree in stages, starting from a given vertex.
- At each iteration, we add one new vertex into the spanning tree.
- A greedy algorithm suffices for correctness:
	- We always add the lowest-weight edge linking a vertex in the tree to a vertex on the outside.

- The simplest implementation of this idea would be to assign to each vertex a Boolean variable denoting whether it is already in the tree (the array `intree` in the code below), and then search all edges at each iteration to find the minimum-weight edge with exactly one `intree` vertex.

- Our implementation is somewhat smarter.
	- It keeps track of the cheapest edge linking every non-tree vertex in the tree,
	- The cheapest such edge over all remaining non-tree vertices gets added in the next iteration.
	- We must update the costs of getting to the non-tree vertices after each insertion.
	- However, since the most recently inserted vertex is the only change in the tree, all possible edge-weight updates must come from its outgoing edges:
```C
int prim(graph *g, int start) {
	int i;                   // Counter
	edgenode *p;             // Temp pointer
	bool intree[MAXV + 1];   // Is the vertex in the tree yet?  
	int distance[MAXV + 1];  // Cost of adding to the tree
	int v;                   // Current vertex to process
	int w;                   // Candidate next vertex
	int dist;                // Cheapest cost to enlarge tree
	int weight = 0;          // Tree weight

	for (i = 1; i <= g->nvertices; i++) {
		intree[i] = false;
		distance[i] = MAXINT;
		parent[i] = -1;
	}

	distance[start] = 0;
	v = start;

	while (!intree[v]) {
		intree[v] = true;
		if (v != start) {
			printf("edge (%d, %d) in tree \n", parent[v], v);
			weight += dist;
		}
		p = g->edges[v];
		while (p != NULL) {
			w = p->y;
			if (distance[w] > p->weight && !intree[w]) {
				distance[w] = p->weight;
				parent[w] = v;
			}
			p = p->next;
		}

		dist = MAXINT;
		for (i = 1; i <= g->nvertices; i++) {
			if (!intree[i] && dist > distance[i]) {
				dist = distance[i];
				v = i;
			}
		}
	}

	return weight;
}
```
##### Analysis
- Prim's algorithm is correct, but how efficient is it?
	- This depends on which data structures are used to implement it.
- In the pseudocode, Prim's algorithm makes *n* iterations sweeping through all *m* edges on each iteration, yielding an $O(nm)$ algorithm.

- But our implementation avoids the need to test all *m* edges on each pass.
	- It only considers the $\leq n$ cheapest known edges represented in the `parent` array, and the $\leq n$ edges out of a new tree vertex *v* to update `parent`.
	- By maintaining a Boolean flag along with each vertex to denote whether it is in the tree, we test whether the current edge joins a tree with a non-tree vertex in constant time.
- The result is an $O(n^2)$ implementation of Prim's algorithm.
	- More sophisticated priority-queue data structures lead to an $O(m+n\lg n)$ implementation, by making it faster to find the minimum-cost edge to expand the tree at each iteration.

- The minimum spanning tree itself can be reconstructed in two ways.
	- The simplest method would be to augment this procedure with statements that print the edges as they are found, and totals the weight of all selected edges to get the cost.
	- Alternatively, the tree topology is encoded in the `parent` array, so it completely describes edges in the MST.
