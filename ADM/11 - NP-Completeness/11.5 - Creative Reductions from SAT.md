- Since both satisfiability and 3-SAT are known to be hard, we can use either of them in future reductions.
	- Usually 3-SAT is the better choice, because it is simpler to work with.
- What follows are a pair of more complicated reductions, designed to serve as examples and also increase our repertoire of known hard problems.
	- Many reductions are quite intricate, because we are essentially programming one problem in the language of a significantly different problem.

- One perpetual point of confusion is getting the direction of the reduction right.
	- Recall that we *must* transform any instance of a known NP-complete problem (Bandersnatch) into an instance of the problem we are really interested in (Bo-billy).
	- If we perform the reduction the other way, all we get is a slow way to solve the problem of interest, by using a subroutine that takes exponential time.
		- This always is confusing at first, because it seems backwards.
	- Make sure you understand the direction of reduction now, and think back to this whenever you get confused.
