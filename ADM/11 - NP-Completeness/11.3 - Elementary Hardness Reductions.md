#Chapter_11 
- The reductions in [[11.2 - Reductions for Algorithms|Section 11.2]] demonstrate transformations between pairs of problems for which efficient algorithms exist.
	- However, we are mainly concerned with using reductions to prove hardness, by showing that *Bo-billy* is at least as hard as *Bandersnatch*.

- For now, I want you to trust me when I say that *Hamiltonian cycle* and *vertex cover* are hard problems.
	- The entire picture (presented in Figure 11.2) will become clear by the end of the chapter.

### 11.3.1 - Hamiltonian Cycle
- The Hamiltonian cycle problem is one of the most famous in graph theory.
	- It seeks a tour that visits each vertex of a given graph exactly once. 
	- Hamiltonian cycle has a long history and many applications, as discussed in Section 19.5. 
- Formally, it is defined as:

- ***Problem:*** Hamiltonian Cycle
- ***Input:*** An unweighted graph G.
- ***Output:*** Does there exist a simple tour that visits each vertex of G without repetition?

- Hamiltonian cycle has some obvious similarity to the traveling salesman problem.
	- Both problems seek a tour that visits each vertex exactly once.
- There are also differences between the two problems.
	- TSP works on weighted graphs, while Hamiltonian cycle works on unweighted graphs.

- The following reduction from Hamiltonian cycle to traveling salesman shows that the similarities are greater than the differences:

HamiltonianCycle($G = (V,E)$)
	Construct a complete weighted graph $G'=(V',E')$, where $V'=V$.
	$n=|V|$
	for $i=1$ to $n$, do:
		for $j = 1$ to $n$, do:
			if $(i,j)\in E$ then $w(i,j)=1$, else $w(i,j)=2$.
	Return the answer to Traveling-Salesman-Decision-Problem$(G' , n)$.

- The actual reduction is quite simple, with the translation from unweighted to weighted graph designed to ensure that the answers of the two problems will be identical.
	- If the graph $G$ has a Hamiltonian cycle $(v_1,...,v_n)$, then this very same tour will correspond to $n$ edges in $E'$ each of weight 1:
		- This defines a TSP tour in $G'$ of weight exactly $n$.
	- If $G$ does not have a Hamiltonian cycle, then every tour in $G'$ must contain at least one weight 2 edge.
		- So there cannot be a TSP tour of weight $n$.

- This reduction is truth preserving and fast, running in $\Theta(n^2)$ time.
- A fast algorithm for TSP would imply a fast algorithm for Hamiltonian cycle, while a hardness proof for Hamiltonian cycle would imply that TSP is hard.
	- Since the latter is the case, this reduction shows that TSP is hard, at least as hard as Hamiltonian cycle.

### 11.3.2 - Independent Set and Vertex Cover
- The vertex cover problem, discussed more thoroughly in Section 19.3 (page 591), asks for a small set of vertices that touch every edge in a graph.
- More formally:

- ***Problem:*** Vertex Cover
- ***Input:*** A graph $G = (V,E)$ and integer $k ≤ |V |$.
- ***Output:*** Is there a subset $S$ of at most $k$ vertices such that every $e \in E$ contains at least one vertex in $S$?

- It is trivial to find *a* vertex cover of a graph: consider the cover that consists of *all* the vertices.
	- More tricky is to cover the edges using as small a set of vertices as possible.
	- For the graph in Figure 11.4, four of the eight vertices are sufficient to cover.

![[Pasted image 20231217185416.png]]

- A set of vertices $S$ of graph $G$ is *independent* if there are no edges $(x, y)$ where both $x \in S$ and $y \in S$.
	- This means there are no edges between any two vertices in an independent set.
- Again, finding *an* independent set is trivial: just take any single vertex.
- As discussed in Section 19.2 (page 589), independent set arises in facility location problems.
- The maximum independent set decision problem is defined:

- ***Problem:*** Independent Set
- ***Input:*** A graph $G$ and integer $k ≤ |V |$.
- ***Output:*** Does there exist a set of *k* independent vertices in *G*?

- Both vertex cover and independent set are problems that revolve around finding special subsets of vertices: 
	- The first with representatives of every edge, the second with no edges.

- If *S* is a vertex cover of *G*, then the remaining vertices $V − S$ must form an independent set, for if there was an edge $(x, y)$ that had both vertices in $V − S$, then $S$ could not have been a vertex cover.

VertexCover(*G, k*)
	$G'=G$
	$k'=|V|-k$
	Return the answer to IndependentSet(G', k')

- Again, a simple reduction shows that one problem is at least as hard as the other.
	- Notice how translation occurs without any knowledge of the answer: we transform the *input*, not the solution.
- This reduction shows that the hardness of vertex cover implies that independent set must also be hard.
	- It is easy to reverse the roles of the two problems in this particular reduction, thus proving that the two problems are equally hard.

### 11.3.3 - Clique
- A social clique is a group of mutual friends who all hang around together. Everyone knows everybody.
- A graph-theoretic clique is a complete subgraph, where each vertex pair has an edge between them.
- Cliques are the densest possible subgraphs:

- ***Problem:*** Maximum Clique
- ***Input:*** A graph $G=(V,E)$ and integer $k ≤ |V |$.
- ***Output:*** Does the graph contain a clique of *k* vertices, meaning is there a subset of vertices *S* where $|S| = k$ such that every pair of vertices in *S* defines an edge of *G*?

- The graph in Figure 11.6 contains a clique of four blue vertices.
	- Within the friendship graph, we would expect to see large cliques corresponding to families, workplaces, neighborhoods, religious organizations, and schools.
	- Applications of clique are further discussed in Section 19.1 (page 586).

![[Pasted image 20231217190539.png]]

- In the independent set problem, we looked for a subset *S* with no edges between two vertices of *S*.
	- This contrasts with clique, where we insist that there *always* be an edge between two vertices.

- A reduction between these problems follows by reversing the roles of edges and non-edges—an operation known as *complementing* the graph:

IndependentSet(*G*, *k*)
	Construct a graph $G'=(V',E')$ where $V'=V$, and
		For all $(i,j)\notin E$, add $(i,j)$ to $E'$
	Return Clique($G',k$)

- These last two reductions provide a chain linking three different problems together.
	- The hardness of clique is implied by the hardness of independent set, which is implied by the hardness of vertex cover.
	- By constructing reductions in a chain, we link together pairs of problems in implications of hardness.
- Our work is complete once all these chains begin with a single “Dwayne Johnson” problem that is accepted as hard.
	- [[11.4 - Satisfiability|Satisfiability]] is the problem that will serve as the first link in this chain.
