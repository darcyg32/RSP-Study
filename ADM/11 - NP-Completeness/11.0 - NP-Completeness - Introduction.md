#Chapter_11
- I will now introduce techniques for proving that *no* efficient algorithm can exist for a given problem.

- The theory of NP-completeness is an immensely useful tool for the algorithm designer, even though all it provides are negative results.
	- The theory of NP-completeness enables us to focus our efforts more productively, by revealing when the search for an efficient algorithm is doomed to failure.
		- Whenever one tries and *fails* to show a problem is hard, that suggests there may well be an efficient algorithm to solve it.

- The theory of NP-completeness also enables us to identify which properties make a particular problem hard.
	- This can provide direction to model it in different ways, or exploit more benevolent characteristics of the problem.
- Developing a sense for which problems are hard is an important skill for algorithm designers, and only comes from hands-on experience with proving hardness.

- The fundamental concept we will use here is *reduction*, showing that two problems are really equivalent.
	- We illustrate this idea through a series of reductions, each of which either yields an efficient algorithm for one problem or an argument that no such algorithm can exist for the other.
- We also provide a brief introduction to the complexity-theoretic aspects of NP-completeness, one of the most fundamental notions in computer science.
