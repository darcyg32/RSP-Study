#Chapter_12 
- In most natural applications of the traveling salesman problem (TSP), direct routes are inherently shorter than indirect routes.
	- For example, when a graph's edge weights are the straight-line distances between pairs of cities, the shortest path from *x* to *y* must always be "as the crow flies."

- The edge weights induced by Euclidean geometry satisfy the *triangle inequality*, namely that $d(u,w)\leq d(u,v) + d(v,w)$ for all triples of vertices *u*, *v*, and *w*.
	- The general reasonableness of this condition is demonstrated in Figure 12.3. ![[Pasted image 20231219132015.png]]
	- The cost of airfares is an example of a distance function that *violates* the triangle inequality, because it is often cheaper to fly through an intermediate city than to fly direct to the destination.
	- But the triangle inequality holds naturally for many problems and applications.

- The traveling salesman problem remains hard when the edge weights are defined by Euclidean distances between points.
	- But we can approximate the optimal traveling salesman tour on such graphs that obey the triangle inequality using minimum spanning trees.

- First, observe that the weight of the minimum spanning tree of graph *G* must be a lower bound on the cost of the optimal TSP tour *T* of *G*.
	- Why? Distances are always non-negative, so deleting any edge from tour *T* leaves a path with total weight no greater than that of *T*.
	- This path has no cycles, and hence is a tree, which means its weight must be *at least* that of the minimum spanning tree.
	- The weight of the minimum spanning tree thus gives a lower bound on the cost of the optimal TSP tour.

- Consider now what happens when performing a depth-first traversal of a spanning tree.
- We visit each edge twice, once going down the tree when discovering the edge and once more going up after exploring the entire subtree.
	- For example, the DFS of Figure 12.4 (left) visits the vertices in order: $1, 2, 1, 3, 5, 8, 5, 9, 5, 3, 6, 3, 1, 4, 7, 10, 7, 11, 7, 4, 1$.
	- This circuit travels along each edge of the minimum spanning tree twice, and hence sots at most twice the optimal tour.

- However, many vertices will be repeated on this DFS circuit.
- To remove the extra copies, we can take a direct path to the next unvisited vertex at each step.
	- The shortcut tour for the circuit above is: $1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 9, 6, 4, 7, 10, 11, 1$.

- Because we have replaced a chain of edges by a single direct edge, the triangle inequality ensures that the tour can only get shorter.
	- Thus, this shortcut tour, which can be constructed in $O(n+m)$ time on an *n*-vertex and *m*-edge graph *G*, always has weight at most twice that of the optimal TSP tour of *G*.

### 12.3.1 - The Christofides Heuristic
- There is another way of looking at this minimum spanning tree doubling idea, which will lead to an even better approximation algorithm for TSP.
- Recall that an *Eularian cycle* in graph *G* is a circuit traversing each edge of *G* exactly once.

- There is a simple characterization to test when a connected graph contains an Eulerian cycle, namely each vertex must be of even degree.
	- This even-degree condition is obviously necessary, because you must be able to walk out of each vertex exactly the number of times you walk in.
	- But it is also sufficient, and furthermore an Eulerian cycle on any connected, even-degree graph can be easily found in linear time.

- We can reinterpret the minimum spanning tree heuristic for TSP in terms of Eularian cycles.
- Construct a multigraph *M*, which consists of *two* copies of each edge of the minimum spanning tree of *G*.
	- This *n*-vertex, $2(n-1)$-edge multigraph must be Eulerian, because every vertex has degree twice that of the minimum spanning tree of *G*.
	- Any Eulerian cycle of *M* will define a circuit with exactly the same properties as the DFS circuit described above, and hence can be shortcut in the same way to construct a TSP tour with cost at most twice that of the optimal tour.

- This suggests that we might find an even better approximation for TSP if we could find a cheaper way to ensure that all vertices are of even degree.
- Recall from [[8.5 - Network Flows and Bipartite Matching|Section 8.5.1]] that a *matching* in a graph $G=(V,E)$ is a subset of edges $E'\subset E$ such that no two edges of $E'$ share a vertex.
	- Adding a set of matching edges to a given graph thus raises the degree of affected vertices by one, turning odd-degree vertices even and even-degree vertices odd, as shown in Figure 12.4 (right).

- So let's start by identifying the odd-degree vertices in the minimum spanning tree of *G*, which are the obstacle preventing us from finding an Eulerian cycle on the minimum spanning tree itself.
	- There must be an even number of odd-degree vertices in any graph.
	- By adding a set of matching edges between these odd-degree vertices, we make the graph Eulerian.
	- The lowest cost *perfect* matching (meaning every vertex must appear in exactly one matching edge) can be computed efficiently, as discussed in Section 18.6.

- The Christofides heuristic constructs a multigraph *M* consisting of the minimum spanning tree of *G* plus the minimum weight set of matching edges between odd-degree vertices in this tree.
	- Thus, *M* is an Eulerian graph, and contains an Eulerian cycle that can be shortcut to build a TSP tour of weight at most *M*.

- Note that the cost of this matching of just the odd-degree vertices must be a lower bound on the cost of the lowest cost matching of the full graph *G*, presuming it satisfies the triangle inequality.

- Observe in Figure 12.5 that the alternating edges of any TSP tour must define a matching, because each vertex appears only once in the given edge set.
	- These red edges (or blue edges) must cost at least as much as the minimum weight matching of *G*, and (for the lighter colour) weight at most half that of the TSP tour.
	- The matching edges we added to *M* thus must have cost at most half that of the optimal TSP tour.

![[Pasted image 20231219135807.png]]
- In conclusion, the total weight of *M* must be at most $(1+(1/2))=(3/2)$ times that of the optimal TSP tour, and thus the Christofides heuristic constructs a tour weight at most 3/2 times that of the optimal tour.
- As with the minimum spanning tree heuristic, the weight lost due to shortcuts might mean the resulting tour is even better than this guarantee. But it can never do worse.
