- Approximation algorithms produce solutions with a guarantee attached, namely that the quality of the optimal solution is provably bounded by the quality of your heuristic solution.
	- Thus, no matter what your input instance is and how lucky you are, such an approximation algorithm is destined to produce a correct answer.
	- Furthermore, provably good approximation algorithms are often conceptually simple, fast, and easy to program.

- One thing that is usually not clear, however, is how well the solution from an approximation algorithm compares to what you might get from a heuristic that gives you no guarantees.
	- The answer may be worse, or it could be better.
		- Leaving your money in a bank savings account may guarantee you 3% interest without risk. Still, you likely will do much better investing your money in stocks than leaving it in the bank, even though performance is not guaranteed.

- One way to get the best of approximation algorithms and unwashed heuristics is to run both of them on the given problem instance, and pick the solution giving the better result.
	- This way, you will get a solution that comes with a guarantee *and* a second chance to do even better.
- When it comes to heuristics for hard problems, sometimes you can have it both ways.
