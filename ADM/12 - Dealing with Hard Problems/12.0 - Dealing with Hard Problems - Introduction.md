#Chapter_12
- For the practical person, demonstrating that problem is [[11.0 - NP-Completeness - Introduction|NP-complete]] is never the end of the line.
- Presumably, there was a reason why you wanted to solve it in the first place.
	- That application won't go away after you learn there is no polynomial-time algorithm.
	- You still seek a program that solves the problem of interest.
	- All you know is that you won't find one that quickly solves the problem to optimality in the worst case.

- There are still three possibilities:
	- *Algorithms fast in the average case:*
		- Examples of such algorithms include backtracking algorithms with substantial pruning.
	- *Heuristics*:
		- Heuristic methods like simulated annealing or greedy approaches can be used to quickly find a solution, albeit with no guarantee that it will be the best one.
	- *Approximation Algorithms*:
		- The theory of NP-completeness stipulates that it is hard to get the *exact* answer.
		- With clever, problem-specific heuristics, we can get provably *close* to the optimal answer on all possible instances.

- This chapter will investigate these possibilities deeper.
