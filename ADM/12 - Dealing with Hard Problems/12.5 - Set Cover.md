#Chapter_12 
- The previous sections may encourage a false belief that every problem can be approximated to within a constant factor.
	- Several catalog problems such as maximum clique cannot be approximated to *any* interesting factor.

- *Set cover* occupies a middle ground between these extremes, having a factor-$\Theta(\lg n)$ approximation algorithm.
	- Set cover is a more general version of the vertex cover problem.
		- As defined in Section 21.1.

- ***Problem:*** Set Cover
- ***Input:*** A collection of subsets $S=\{S_1,...,S_m\}$ of the universal set $U=\{1,...,n\}$
- ***Output:*** What is the smallest subset *T* of *S* whose union equals the universal set (i.e. $\cup^{|T|}_{i=1}T_i=U$)?

- The natural heuristic is greedy.
- Repeatedly select the subset that covers the largest collection of thus-far uncovered elements, until everything is covered.
- In pseudocode:

SetCover(*S*)
	While $(U\neq\emptyset)$ do:
		Identify the subset $S_i$ with the largest intersection with *U*
		Select $S_i$ for the set cover
		$U=U-S_i$

- One consequence of this selection process is that the number of freshly covered elements defines a non-increasing sequence as the algorithm proceeds.
	- Why? If not, greedy would have picked the more powerful subset earlier if it existed.

- Thus we can view this heuristic as reducing the number of uncovered elements from *n* down to zero by progressively smaller amounts.
	- A trace of such execution is shown in Figure 12.6.
	- An important milestone in such a trace occurs each time the number of remaining uncovered elements reduces past a power of two.
		- Clearly there can be at most $\lg n$ such events.

- Let $w_i$ denote the number of subsets that were selected by the heuristic to cover elements between milestones $2^{i+1}-1$ and $2^i$.
- Define the width *w* to be the maximum $w_i$, where $0\leq i\leq \lg n$.
- In the example of Figure 12.6, the maximum width is given by the five subsets needed to go from $2^5-1$ down to $2^4$.

- Since there are at most $\lg n$ such milestones, the solution produced by the greedy heuristic must contain at most $w*\lg n$ subsets.
- But I claim that the optimal solution must contain *at least* $w$ subsets, so the heuristic solution is no worse than $\lg n$ times optimal.

- Why? Consider the average number of new elements covered as we move between milestones $2^{i+1}-1$ and $2^i$.
	- These $2^i$ elements require $w_i$ subsets, so the average coverage is $\mu_i=2^i/w_i$.
- More to the point, the last/smallest of these subsets can cover at most $\mu_i$ subsets.
	- Thus, *no subset exists in S that can cover more than $\mu_i$ of the remaining $2^i$ elements*.
- So, to finish the job, we need at least $2^i/\mu_i=w_i$ subsets.

- The surprising thing here is that there are set cover instances where the greedy heuristic finds solutions that are $\Omega(\lg n)$ times optimal:
	- Recall the bas vertex cover instance of Figure 12.2.
- This logarithmic approximation ration is an inherent property of the problem/heuristic, not an artifact of weak analysis.

- ***Take-Home Lesson:***
	- ***Approximation algorithms guarantee answers that are always close to the optimal solution.*
	- ***They can provide a practical approach to dealing with NP-complete problems.*
