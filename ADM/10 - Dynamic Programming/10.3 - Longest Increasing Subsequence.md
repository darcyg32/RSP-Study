#Chapter_10 
- There are three steps involved in solving a problem by dynamic programming:
	- Formulate the answer you want as a [[5.3 - Recurrence Relations|recurrence relation]] or recursive algorithm.
	- Show that the number of different parameter values taken on by your recurrence is bounded by a (hopefully small) polynomial.
	- Specify an evaluation order for the recurrence so the partial results you need are always available when you need them.

- To see how this is done, let's see how we would develop an algorithm to find the longest monotonically increasing subsequence within a sequence of *n* numbers.
	- This was described as a special case of edit distance in [[10.2 - Approximate String Matching|Section 10.2]], where it was called *maximum monotone subsequence*.
		- Still, it is instructive to work it out from scratch.
		- Dynamic programming algorithms are often easier to reinvent than look up.

- We distinguish an increasing sequence from a *run*, where the elements must be physical neighbours of each other.
- The selected elements of both must be sorted in increasing order from left to right.
- For example, consider the sequence $S=(2, 4, 3, 5, 1, 7, 6, 9, 8)$.
	- The longest increasing subsequence of *S* is of length 5: $(2,3,5,6,8)$.
		- There are actually 8 of this length.
	- There are four increasing runs of length 2: (2, 4), (3, 5), (1, 7), and (6, 9).

- Finding the longest *run* in a numerical sequence is straightforward.
	- You should be able to easily devise a linear-time algorithm.
- But finding the longest increasing subsequence is considerably trickier.
	- How can we identify which scattered elements to skip?

- To apply dynamic programming, we need to design a recurrence relation for the length of the longest sequence.
	- To find the right recurrence, ask what information about the first $n-1$ elements of $S=(s_1,...,s_n)$ would enable you to find the answer for the entire sequence.

- The length *L* of the longest increasing sequence in $s_1,s_2,...,s_{n-1}$ seems a useful thing to know.
	- In fact, this will be the length of the longest increasing sequence in *S*, unless $s_n$ extends some increasing sequence of the same length.
	- Unfortunately, this length *L* is not enough information to complete the full solution.
		- Suppose I told you that the longest increasing subsequence in $(s_1,s_2,...,s_{n-1})$ was of length 5 and that $s_n=8$.
			- Will the length of the longest increasing subsequence of S be 5 or 6?
				- It depends on whether the length-5 sequence ended with a value < 8.
- We need to know the length of the longest sequence that $s_n$ will extend.
	- To be certain we know this, we really need the length of the longest sequence ending at *every* possible value $s_i$.

- This provides the idea around which to build a recurrence.
	- Define $L_i$ to be the length of the longest sequence ending with $s_i$.
	- The longest sequence containing $s_n$ will be formed by appending it to the longest increasing sequence to the left of *n* that ends on a number smaller than $s_n$.
- The following recurrence computes $L_i$:
	- $L_i=1+\max_{\{0\leq j<i, s_j<s_i\}}L_j$,
	- $L_0=0$.

- These values define the length of the longest increasing subsequence ending at each sequence element.
	- The length of the longest increasing subsequence of *S* is given by $L=\max_{1\leq i\leq n}L_i$, since the winning sequence must end somewhere.
- Here is the table associated with our previous example:

- What auxiliary information will we need to store to reconstruct the actual sequence instead of its length?
	- For each element $s_i$, we will store its *predecessor* - the index $p_i$ of the element that appears immediately before $s_i$ in a longest increasing subsequence ending at $s_i$.
		- Since all of these pointers go towards the left, it is a simple matter to start from the last value of the largest sequence and follow the pointers back so as to reconstruct the other items in the sequence.

- What is the time complexity of this algorithm?
	- Each one of the *n* values of $L_i$ is computed by comparing $s_i$ against the $i-1\leq n$ values to the left of it, so this analysis gives a total of $O(n^2)$ time.
		- In fact, by using dictionary data structures in a clever way, we can evaluate this recurrence in $O(n\lg n)$ time.
			- However, the simple recurrence would be easy to program and therefore is a good place to start.
