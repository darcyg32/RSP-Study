#Chapter_10 
- The *knapsack* or *subset sum* problem askes whether there exists a subset $S'$ of an input multiset of *n* positive integers $S=\{s_1,...,s_n\}$ whose elements add up to a given target *k*.
	- Think of a backpacker trying to completely fill up a knapsack of capacity *k* with possible selections from set *S*.

- Dynamic programming works best on linearly ordered items, so we can consider them from left to right.
	- The ordering of items in *S* from $s_1$ to $s_n$ provides such an arrangement.
	- To formulate a recurrence relation, we need to determine what information we need on items $s_1$ to $s_{n-1}$ in order to decide what to do about $s_n$.

- Here is the idea. Either the *n*th integer $s_n$ is part of a subset adding up to *k*, or it is not.
	- If it is, then there must be a way to make a subset of the first $n-1$ elements of *S* adding up to $k-s_n$, so the last element can finish the job.
	- If not, there may well be a solution that does not use $s_n$.
- Together, this defines the recurrence: $T_{n,k}=T_{n-1,k} \lor T_{n-1,k-s_n}$.
	- $A\lor B$ is true if *A* and/or *B* are true. If both are false, the statement is false.
- This gives an $O(nk)$ algorithm to decide whether target *k* is realizable:

```C
bool sum[MAXN + 1][MAXN + 1];      // Table of realizable sums.
								   // sum[i][j] indicates whether it's possible to  
								   // reach the sum j using the first i elements of s[]

int parent[MAXN + 1][MAXN + 1];    // Table of parent pointers.
								   // stores the index of the previous element that 
								   // contributed to the subset sum j using the first
								   // i elements of s[]

bool subset_sum(int s[], int n, int k) {
	int i, j;    // Counters

	// Base case: an empty subset can always sum up to 0
	sum[0][0] = true;
	parent[0][0] = NIL;

	// Initialize the first row of the table for the base case
	for (i = 1; i <= k; i++) {
		sum[0][i] = false;
		parent[0][i] = NIL;
	}

	// Build table
	for (i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
		for (j = 0; j <= k; j++) {
			// Copy the result from the previous row
			sum[i][j] = sum[i - 1][j];
			parent[i][j] = NIL;

			// Check if including the current element can achieve the sum 'j'
			if ((j >= s[i - 1]) && (sum[i - 1][j - s[i - 1]] == true)) {
				sum[i][j] = true;
				// Store the parent pointer for backtracking
				parent[i][j] = j - s[i - 1];
			}
		}
	}

	return sum[n][k];
}
```

- Check `(j >= s[i - 1])`:
	- If the current element $s[i-1]$ cannot help us reach *j* if it's larger than *j*, as we will just go over.
		- So if we cannot get to *j* with the elements with the elements before the current element $s[i=1]$, we won't be able to get to *j* with it. But if we can, we don't need *j* to get to it anyway, so we can proceed.
- Check `(sum[i-1][j - s[i - 1]] == true)`:
	- Check whether it's possible to achieve the sum `j - s[i - 1]` (the sum minus the current element) using the elements up to the previous element (indicated in the `sum[i-1]` row).
- If these are both true, then we can reach *j* using the current element.
	- We set `sum[i][j] = true`, indicating that we can reach *j* using elements up to `sum[i-1]`.
	- We then store the index of the previous element that contributed to reaching *j* in `parent[i][j]` (`j - s[i-1])`.

- The `parent` table encodes the actual subset of numbers totaling to *k*.
- An appropriate subset exist whenever `sum[n][k] == true`, but it does not use $s_n$ as an element when `parent[n][k] == NIL`.
	- Instead, we walk up the matrix until we find an interesting parent, and follow the corresponding pointer:

```C
void report_subset(int n, int k) {
	if (k == 0) {
		return;
	}

	if (parent[n][k] == NIL) {
		report_subset(n - 1, k);
	} else {
		report_subset(n - 1, parent[n][k]);
		printf(" %d ", k - parent[n][k]);
	}
}
```

- Below is an example showing the `sum` table for input set $S=\{1,2,4,8\}$ and target $k=11$.
	- The true in the lower right corner signals that the sum is realizable.
	- Because *S* here represents all the powers of twos, and every target integer can be written in binary, the entire bottom row consists of trues:

- Below is the corresponding `parents` array, encoding the solution $1+2+8=11$.
	- The 3 in the lower right corner reflects that $11-8=3$.
	- The red bolded cells represent those encountered on the walk back to recover the solution.

- To trace back from the target sum to the initial subset, we start at the last element and find it's parent (the index of previous element contributing to the sum). We add these elements to our subset and repeat.

- The alert reader might wonder how we can have an $O(nk)$ algorithm for subset sum when subset sum is an NP-complete problem?
	- Isn't this polynomial in *n* and *k*? Did we just prove that $P=NP$?
- Unfortunately no.
- Note that the target number *k* can be specified using $O(\log k)$ bits, meaning that this algorithm runs in time exponential in the *size* of the input, which is $O(n\log k)$.
	- This is the same reason why factoring integer *N* by explicitly testing all $\sqrt{N}$ candidates for smaller factor is not polynomial, because the running time is exponential in the $O(\log N)$ bits of the input.

- Another way to see the problem is to consider what happens to the algorithm when we take a specific problem instance and multiply each integer by 1,000,000.
	- Such a transform would not have affected the running time of sorting or minimum spanning tree, or any algorithm we have seen so far in this book.
	- But it would slow down our dynamic programming algorithm by a factor of 1,000,000, and require a million times as much space for storing the table.
- The range of the numbers matters in the subset sum problem, which becomes hard for large integers.
